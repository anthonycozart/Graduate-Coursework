Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's second quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. To start, let me make a few summary comments.', 'It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We have tightened control of discretionary spending, reduced employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter.', 'Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental margin on return on sales for the past three quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end.', 'Moving on to specifics for the second quarter, sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4% and organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness.', 'Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis.', \"During the second quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure.\", \"In previous downturns, in which we've experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. The primary drivers of our margin performance include: savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods; immediate and decisive actions on cost containment; and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented.\", 'Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs.', 'Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%.', 'During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over two years, which began in October 2014.', 'Moving on to the discussion on key market trends, as projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas.', 'We continued to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail, and heavy-duty truck.', 'In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call.', 'Now switching to our outlook; for fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second-half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter.', 'We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy.', \"So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are: targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production; we're also targeting 17% segment operating margins; and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.\", 'We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top quartile company, compared with our proxy peers. Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings, and to leverage e-Business and Internet of Things capabilities.', \"During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-Business capabilities. We see opportunity to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy, grow our business and create a better customer experience. Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas.\", \"In summary, execution of the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top quartile performance versus our proxy peers. So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Tom.', \"And at this time, please refer to slide number five. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.\", \"On slide number six, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY 2015 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share.\", 'Increases to adjusted per-share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit.', 'Reductions to adjusted per-share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various one-time favorable adjustments were recognized.', 'Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter, total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year; there was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than plan, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter.', 'Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets.', \"Moving to slide number eight, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 1.3% in the quarter.\", 'Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets.', \"I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on slide number nine. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%.\", 'Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets.', \"I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales.\", 'Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.', 'Moving to slide number 11, with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.', \"The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter-end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial's segments stemming from natural resource related end markets, as Tom mentioned.\", 'Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior-year comparables.', 'On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year.', 'In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter, and we have $75 million for CapEx equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date.', 'Slide number 13, provides for FY 2016 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%.', 'Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY 2016.', 'For total Parker, adjustment segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category other is $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 137.1 million shares.', 'For the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.', 'Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 49%, first-half, 51% second-half; adjustment segment operating income is divided 49% first-half, 51% second-half; adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first-half and $3.06 in the second-half; Q3 FY 2016 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses.', \"On slide number 14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate, $0.13 from reduced corporate G&A, interest, and other, and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets.\", 'Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.', \"This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jon. We expect the difficult environment to continue through the rest of our fiscal year. As our margins here today indicate, we are responding well. We are making meaningful progress with our restructuring initiatives, which remain on track for the year. We also continue to find opportunities to streamline operations through our simplification initiatives.', \"I am very encouraged by the response of our partner team members. It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced a new path forward for Parker, and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy.\", 'I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress throughout this year. At this time, we are ready to take questions. So, Abigail, if you would like to get us started?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Hey, guys. This is James Picariello filling in for Jeff. Just a quick question on order trends. Can you speak to maybe the pace of what you're seeing through January and how that maybe compares to, in December and November?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"This is Jon. I think, James, the pattern is consistent with what we saw during Q2. I think what we're seeing in January is consistent with what we're seeing in guidance. January is, of course – the first two weeks of January are a little bit – very difficult to judge, but I think from what we can tell so far that we're consistent with the guidance that we've got together for Q3. So, nothing really remarkable to give you an answer on there.\", 'James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Okay. And just to follow-up. On Aerospace, what's the visibility in terms of the mix between OE and aftermarket for the back half? Just trying to get a better understanding for the margins?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, it would be, in general, we have good visibility for the OE, and the question is always in the aftermarket. What is included in our guidance is 65% OE, 35% aftermarket. That's what we've been running consistently for the last several quarters. There's a little bit of variation periodically, but that's what we're projecting here for the balance of the year.\", 'James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Thanks, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Nicole.', 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"So, I guess, I'll ask the question that someone's bound to ask is, can you guys go through your usual spiel on how the end markets progressed during the quarter?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"Nicole, this is Lee. Like I've done before in the past, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets and I'll also comment on our distribution channel.\", \"I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource driven markets, ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really by and large continue to be challenging everywhere around the world.\", \"So, starting off with North America, I think, oil and gas, in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Having said that, if I focus on distribution that doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas, we've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base that is still very difficult.\", \"Looking at, really, air conditioning, refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result, obviously, of the continued strengthening in the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf and then really an increase in product content which has to do with the SEER efficiency changes that incurred last year. So, we're really happy what's happening in those markets.\", 'Commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017.', \"And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which would be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth and this is really based on the markets but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment. So, very positive there.\", \"Touching back on North America oil and gas, as I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year 2016 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable in today's oil prices.\", 'Turning to agriculture, we continue to see topline declines, which is consistent I think in contraction and production schedules at our major customers. So, very weak on the agricultural equipment side.', 'On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects.', 'On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us. And it was excellent, but consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward.', 'On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business; the market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there.', \"And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive, our key North American distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus – Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders who cover this area. So that's North America.\", \"In Europe, there's – well, I'll comment on Europe. So, if I talk about distribution, weak overall with Q2 down versus last year. But, I think, what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really UK, Norway – it's up year-over-year. And we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution.\", \"We continue to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions and this is a highlight; if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries.\", \"Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill, looking at the UK capital investment, North Sea has dropped significantly. But, we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets. Really systems that eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies.\", 'Agriculture is still pretty much the same as North America, production rate is low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins for energy grid tie systems and it really is a complement to our growth and the Renewable Energy segments.', \"Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2.\", 'Turning to Asia, distribution as a total is flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy, of expanding our distribution points around the world. And we are doing that in the region.', \"Oil and gas, again, is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China and I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies, they still continue to invest, maybe at somewhat of a reduced rate.\", \"On energy, in the region, really I'm speaking to China mostly, renewable, wind, solar and hydro is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal powers, coal, gas, nuclear is still taking a major share.\", \"On rail, and this really speaks to China, we continue to be very bullish on the rail market; the Chinese government is making significant investments in this area. We've had – there is a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed rail, technology in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment, we continue to have strong participation across that rail market in China.\", \"On mobile construction, I can't say anything has progressed positive, since the last time we talked, there continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia-Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand.\", \"And then lastly, just talking to Latin America, it's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details. I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition and we've seen softness in all our end markets, mining, PowerGen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera.\", 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Okay. Thanks, Lee, that was really, really helpful.', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"So, just one quick follow-up, if you guys don't mind. So, on 3Q, you're guiding for $1.40 EPS at the midpoint. Typically, EPS steps up Q-on-Q. I know there were some below line puts and takes within the second quarter that are probably messing up that seasonality a bit. But I'm just curious are you guys embedding a deterioration in organic growth in 3Q compared to 2Q?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Let me start, Nicole. This is Tom. And I'll let Jon add on. What we did for the second half is basically we took the order entry that we saw that Lee described all the regions of the markets in the second quarter, which really, Aerospace orders got better, less negative, and Industrial North America got worse by three points and International got worse by two points. So, we took that order entry and basically translated that into the second half on an organic growth standpoint. So, our second-half organic growth from our previous guide used to be minus 5% and now it's minus 7.5%. So, we dropped it 2.5 points organically and then we have the second half coming at a minus 15% decremental MROS and that's how you get the second half EPS numbers.\", 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'll pass it on.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Your line is open.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', \"Let me just follow-up on Nicole's question and just clarify. As a clarification, what was the adjusted tax rate in the second quarter? And is the big difference between the third quarter and second quarter is a little bit of seasonality upturn being offset by a 28% tax rate assumption?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, first of all, the effective tax rate for the three months in Q2 was 20.3% and that's related to the passage of the extenders. Going forward into Q3, our run rate going forward is 28%, although it's just slightly higher in our Q3 that we've built in here due to a couple of items that we will account for it in the quarter, Eli.\", 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'Yeah. But that 28% versus the 20.3% is sort of like $0.12 to $0.15 or some number like that of the...', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', \"...difference in earnings and that almost accounts the difference between $1.52 and $1.40 that you're sort of forecasting for us.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. We are not – we are down – are down in the top line versus our old guidance in Q3 and we're also down commensurately at the operating income. But I've got, like I said, a slightly higher rate in Q3 due to some discrete items that we're accounting for in our tax rate there.\", 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', \"All right. And can we talk a little bit about the profitability, the lower profitability you're forecasting for the year? Most of that, I assume, is volume. Is there any changes in pricing going on in the marketplace? Are you able to hold pricing? I mean, we assume cost will continue to trend downward just because of the lower input costs. But can you a little bit, talk a little bit about what's going on in the – I assume the drop in margins that sort of are embedded it's like drop is a little volume related and that pricing looks like it's relatively stable in the industry?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Eli, this is Lee. I think the drop is all volume-related. Pricing has been flat. We forecasted it to be flat going forward.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'And input costs are still trending downward?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"They've been favorable.\", 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'Yeah. All right. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.

Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Andy.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'A couple of questions related to your guidance. First, if we look back on Q2, can you give us the components of – there was quite a bit of difference between the initial $1.16 midpoint guidance and the reported $1.52. Understand tax was part of it. But what else changed?', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I mean, I think at the SG&A level for the quarter as Tom said, we've got some positive variance in the corporate G&A of about $18 million versus the prior guide. And that's due to the simplification efforts and a couple one-time adjustments that won't repeat. We've also got as compared to the prior guide, a small settlement of about $4 million for a contractual issue that we had in the other expense. That's about $4 million and that accounts for about $0.02.\", 'And, of course, Eli talked about the tax rate. And we had guided to a higher tax rate and again we did not know that the extenders was going to pass; and so of course, that turned out to be good news for us and that gave us $0.15 versus the prior guide.', 'And then at the operating income level, even with the reduced – projected reduced revenues, we were able to get approximately $15 million in additional operating income versus the prior guide on a slight beat in revenues.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thanks, Jon. And then on that $15 million, is that repeatable – that should carry through going forward?', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. Well, that is built into our guidance going forward and we feel very good about our cost structure and with the simplification efforts and our restructuring efforts are bringing for us and built into our guidance is additional savings that we're going to get from the restructuring efforts that we've been going through here in the first half of this year and at the end of last year.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thanks. And then a couple detail, I guess. First, on North American Industrial, did you see inventory destocking change during the quarter, meaning did it intensify, moderate or kind of stay the same versus the prior quarter?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"Andy, it's Lee. I would say it just stayed about the same. I mean at the end of the day it's really hard for us to get a gauge on that. But it certainly didn't get worse.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', \"Okay. Thanks, Lee. And then real quick on the last one, Aerospace outlook. Are you embedding the same sort of fourth-quarter bump up that you've seen in the last couple of years?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Andy, we really are not. What we've embedded in there is the continuation of the 35% MRO, 65% OEM at around the same relative profitability that we see right now. These last couple of years we've seen these one-time settlements get agreed to. And they have impacted the number so I understand completely your question. But that's not something that we would project in our guidance going forward here and so I don't really have any context for you on that point.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.

Are you seeing any kind of an inflection point looking at your 3-12s and your 12-12s? Anything bottoming out there, particularly in North America?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"Ann, in all candor, I don't have my 3-12 and 12-12s in front of me. I can bring those back in the future. But, I would say the comps are going to start getting easier in some of those numbers, so it's just a matter of time. I mean obviously oil and gas, just from memory it is still decelerating. But, I would just be winging it here if I tried to give you any more context than that.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Ann, it's Tom. I think our assumption is there's really no meaningful recovery in the second half and what you see if you do the comparables it's just really easier comparables for us in the second half.\", 'Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate it. And then you did comment on customers talking about how weak the end markets are. Were you talking about distribution customers, particularly in oil and gas, or were you talking about OEMs? If you just could tell us what are the conversations like between OEMs versus your distribution?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"They are the same, quite frankly. Our distribution is involved with MRO but also with some projects, and handling it's very, very much the same. It's the same conversation.\", 'Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.', 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, I know someone asked before on material costs and you said it was a benefit, but could you quantify what you're assuming for material costs and your guidance versus when you initially guided? Because I'm just trying to understand the decrementals that you guys are putting up, which have been much better than expected. I get that it's the simplification initiatives and restructuring as well.\", \"And then also, Tom, if you could just comment on the sustainability of sort of mid-to-high teen decremental margins. We haven't seen that before from Parker?\", \"And then my last question is just balance sheet; given the depressed markets you're seeing, are any – I know when we spoke last, you said valuations on acquisitions were still quite elevated. Has there been any change in the market? Thank you.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay, Jamie. This is Tom. So, I'll start with the material costs side. I would say compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the material side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us.\", \"And we feel good about this fiscal year, I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year in trying to tell you what the margin return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability.\", \"We've done it three quarters in a row, and I think for everybody on the phone to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did; all of the teams moved out very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment. Then we launched the simplification plan which really was more strategic restructuring, in addition to the footprint restructuring we were doing that enabled us to keep these very nice basically half of what we historically have done.\", \"And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the 2001 reduction – we were – the recession, it was a minus 60% MROS. The great recession was around minus 40% and here we are in that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low-20%s even reported all in. So, I think it's sustainable and that's what we have in the plan for the next two quarters.\", \"On the balance sheet, the acquisitions – the pipeline is active, but valuations are still high and I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from seller's expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think the time is on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that they – it's maybe not going to grow what they thought it was the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more line and I think our pipeline will become more actionable at that point. So, it's lumpy, it's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Sorry, Tom. One just quick follow-up on the simplification initiatives. Because as you look to 2017 there could be very high probability that things don't improve or that sales could decline. Based on what you're seeing with sort of the simplification initiatives, do you feel like you guys perhaps there's more there to do or you're realizing greater savings than you initially thought that again the sustainability of the decrementals could be better than what you originally thought?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, I think that is possible. I don't want to get above my skis for 2017. We'll talk about that in August. But, yes, I mean, what we've seen with sustainability for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring.\", \"The good thing about it, and just to remind people, there is four areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity so that's that tail of the revenue; we're looking at the bottom tail, that density of part numbers and (44:25) activity, just the cost to sustain that. We're very early days of getting into that. I mean that's a little more difficult for us to work but very early days of that.\", \"And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that, so that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it, so we're at 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll see us continue to work that.\", \"And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it. All the things that just slows things down, and that obviously carries cost and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where – what this could mean for us. And I think most everybody has seen the walk on taking us to 17% operating margins, simplification is the biggest bar on the walk. So, we clearly think there's more there.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"All righty, thanks. I'll get back in queue.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Thanks. Good morning, everyone.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Joe.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Tom, maybe staying on the simplification and restructuring spend for a second, it looks like the first couple of quarters, the spend is coming a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And so, I guess, my question is really just around your confidence on your ability to complete the actions this year and to get the roughly $70 million in benefits that you are expecting to receive from those actions. Any color there would be great.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Joe. It's Tom. So, our restructuring year-to-date is right on the money. So, we've forecasted 60% of the $100 million and we're at $57 million. So, we're very, very close to that number. And our savings are tracking and so I am very confident we're going to deliver both the cost that we had planned, the $100 million of cost and deliver the savings. And the savings is indicative of that is the marginal return on sales. We could not be delivering these kind of returns without the actions that we've taken, simplification being one of them that's helping us.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"Got it. So, yeah, maybe my numbers are off a little bit in the first half. I can follow up after the call. But, maybe one other key point is I noticed the free cash flow thus far has been pretty impressive and looks like this quarter working capital was a source of cash. I was wondering was there anything one-time or anything special – like I saw both the receivables and the inventory line down? Just curious what's driving the strong free cash flow.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Jon, here, Joe. We are very much focused on cash flow every single day here in the company here and watching as the top lines moves, what's going on there. All of our operating metrics are very good, nothing is deteriorating. We remain focused on the simplification efforts and our company is doing everything we can from a lean standpoint to improve every single process that we've got throughout the company. And we're seeing it in the cash flow statement. So, we're very proud of that.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones, Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Good morning, Tom, Jon, Lee.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Nathan.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Lee, in some of your comments about the end markets, you said that North American distribution was positive ex-oil and gas. I think our checks had indicated your North American distribution overall was down about 3%. Is that pretty close to right?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Total North American distribution?', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Yeah.', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Yeah. It would be down single-digits year-over-year.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"So, I think that implies that the direct channel from 2Q to – I'm sorry from 1Q to 2Q saw a fairly significant decline in the comp. Can you talk about any specific end markets that might have driven that?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"I want to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about our direct customers?\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Direct or OEM, the non-distribution channel.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom. I'll chime in. What we saw in distribution in Q2 was primarily North America took a step down, but outside of North America it held up pretty well, Europe, Asia held up pretty nicely.\", 'So, the step down in North America really was indicative of the same step down we saw OEMs, which was the natural resource markets, a little bit of a knock-on into the general industrial space that knocked both distribution and the OEMs down. But, in general, OEMs have been down about two times what distribution has been down if you were to characterize the difference.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"Okay. That helps. And then with nine months to go on the original plan for $2 billion to $3 billion of share repurchase, it looks like you're kind of gliding into more of the low end of that. Is that keeping powder dry for some expected correction in the pricing in the M&A market for you and with an eye to getting perhaps more aggressive as we go forward on M&A?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Nathan, this is Tom. Good question. I'm sure this is on top of everybody's mind. So, we feel very good about what we've done so far. We're 87% of the way through to the low end of the $2 billion to $3 billion range.\", \"And maybe if I could just give a little color to the process that we – so every quarter, we sit down and it's really a cash allocation discussion. We look at cash generation capabilities, you know what do we think we're going to generate at closed-loop model taking a look at that. Where is the cash generated? What access do we have to the cash? And also with our goal that we'd like to maintain an A-rating as we go through this for a lot of good reasons.\", \"But on the deployment side, we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders comparing – recognizing, hey, we're going to do the dividends first. We're not going to move off of that, we're going to fund organic growth, but then we're going to look at the balance of share repurchase versus acquisitions to try to make that best decision.\", \"So, it's hard for me to give you a specific number that will land on the share repurchase, because it's really an opportunistic look weighing those various tugs and pulls every quarter as we go through that closed-loop model.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Fair enough. And if I could just go off the beaten path a little bit here, you talked about 2Q developing a comprehensive e-Business plan. And also talked a little bit more about development of the Internet of Things plan. Could you give us a little bit more color on where you are with that, how long the rollout looks to take and where the benefits come from that?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay, Nathan, this is Tom again. So, I'm going to start on e-Business and I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here, because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would, because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors in trying to help them be successful. Let me just suffice it to say that what we want on the e-Business side is we want a Google like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website.\", \"And we've launched a number of things that we think will get us there, it's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress we think over the last couple of years and as we talked to our customers and distributors they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there.\", \"So, we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remembering that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So, that's why we want this to be so important, we're investing in it, we made some organizational design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year.\", \"On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people are not familiar with what that is, it's basically an ideation process, where you gather ideas from around the company. And that coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all of the applications throughout the company, has really given us a program for ideas. So, we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon. We have narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best most commercial actionable projects. And we think that has got multimillion-dollar type of look – tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next three years. Most of that's not going to cut into probably towards the end of FY 2017 and FY 2018, it's probably going to take a year-and-a-half incubation here.\", \"We do have two good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them that the smart service kit, which is helping us in the refrigeration primarily the air-conditioning market, so if you take an air-conditioning contractor today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures and so this is a patented sensor that we have. It allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air-conditioning unit much more rapid, so the value for the contractors as many more calls happens during the call, they can get a print out right on their smartphone or visual on their smartphones and print it out if they want it for the customer, so they can see what's going on with their unit. So, we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales.\", \"And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go in – our check valves very sticky, but then our contractors absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you go to our website you can probably find a video of one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"Great.

So, let's not count this question. But, are you guys getting any transaction benefit? I think a year-ago, you were talking about that it takes about a year to recertify some of the plants to ship stuff from Europe to the U.S. Are you doing it? Are you being able to do it? Are we seeing any benefit from this?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, Andrew, you know we are constantly trying to make sure that we're producing the right parts at the right locations and the right plants. And so we are not, from a transactional standpoint, getting hurt as bad as we would have been say this time last year in terms of the margins. So that is one piece of progress that we've been making, it is not – that's one of about 10 or 15 things that are going our way that are helping us with our margins and our decrementals.\", \"So, we don't see that getting bad. We're adjusting. It was this time last year where the euro and the Swiss franc decoupled and also when the dollar was really getting stronger. And so, we have adjusted to that where we stand right now today and that's what's built into our guidance going forward.\", 'Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', 'And just a question on capital allocation, given where the high-yield markets are, given that PE can no longer play, given where the stock prices are, how do you guys feel about your M&A funnel?', 'Thomas L.

I think it's a little bit of a delayed effect as the seller's expectations on revenue hasn't come down to earth yet. But, time is on our side. They will come down and we continue those discussions. And what we've seen over time is eventually we come to the terms with better revenue forecast.\", \"We haven't taken action on some deals in the past mainly because of the difference in pricing and that pricing difference is primarily geared by differences in what we thought the revenue expectation was going to be for that business.\", 'Jon P.

Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"We're structurally going to be down slightly from our past run rate, but it was more of a couple one-time things in the corporate G&A. We're focused on about between $45 million to $48 million going forward here in the corporate G&A going forward as compared to in the mid-$50 million in Q1 and in prior years. So, this has some structural benefits from the simplification, but it would be wrong for me to not mention that there were some one-time items in Q2 for our G&A expense.\", 'Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)', \"Okay. And is there a big target on the business simplification? I think you used to have 240 divisions and now you mentioned it's down by 28. Is there any sort of a goal or is it just – it's going to end up where it naturally ought to be?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Joel, just to – it's Tom. To clarify, the number of divisions that we have operating divisions is 115. So, the 28 is in the 115. So, both Lee and I, the message we've left with the group presidents is we're looking for natural combinations that helps us just be more efficient, give us the scale that we need to better grow synergies and better cost synergies. We have some divisions that I think if we looked at it in hindsight had too much technology or product charter overlap, and it made more sense to put them together. So, it's not going to be one division. We still believe in a decentralized model. We still believe in driving that P&L ownership closest to our team members.

Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. To start, let me make a few summary comments.', 'It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We have tightened control of discretionary spending, reduced employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter.', 'Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental margin on return on sales for the past three quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end.', 'Moving on to specifics for the second quarter, sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4% and organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness.', 'Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis.', \"During the second quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure.\", \"In previous downturns, in which we've experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. The primary drivers of our margin performance include: savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods; immediate and decisive actions on cost containment; and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented.\", 'Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs.', 'Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%.', 'During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over two years, which began in October 2014.', 'Moving on to the discussion on key market trends, as projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas.', 'We continued to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail, and heavy-duty truck.', 'In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call.', 'Now switching to our outlook; for fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second-half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter.', 'We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy.', \"So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are: targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production; we're also targeting 17% segment operating margins; and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.\", 'We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top quartile company, compared with our proxy peers. Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings, and to leverage e-Business and Internet of Things capabilities.', \"During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-Business capabilities. We see opportunity to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy, grow our business and create a better customer experience. Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas.\", \"In summary, execution of the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top quartile performance versus our proxy peers. So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Tom.', \"And at this time, please refer to slide number five. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.\", \"On slide number six, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY 2015 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share.\", 'Increases to adjusted per-share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit.', 'Reductions to adjusted per-share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various one-time favorable adjustments were recognized.', 'Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter, total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year; there was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than plan, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter.', 'Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets.', \"Moving to slide number eight, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 1.3% in the quarter.\", 'Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets.', \"I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on slide number nine. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%.\", 'Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets.', \"I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales.\", 'Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.', 'Moving to slide number 11, with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.', \"The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter-end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial's segments stemming from natural resource related end markets, as Tom mentioned.\", 'Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior-year comparables.', 'On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year.', 'In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter, and we have $75 million for CapEx equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date.', 'Slide number 13, provides for FY 2016 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%.', 'Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY 2016.', 'For total Parker, adjustment segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category other is $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 137.1 million shares.', 'For the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.', 'Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 49%, first-half, 51% second-half; adjustment segment operating income is divided 49% first-half, 51% second-half; adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first-half and $3.06 in the second-half; Q3 FY 2016 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses.', \"On slide number 14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate, $0.13 from reduced corporate G&A, interest, and other, and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets.\", 'Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.', \"This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jon. We expect the difficult environment to continue through the rest of our fiscal year. As our margins here today indicate, we are responding well. We are making meaningful progress with our restructuring initiatives, which remain on track for the year. We also continue to find opportunities to streamline operations through our simplification initiatives.', \"I am very encouraged by the response of our partner team members. It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced a new path forward for Parker, and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy.\", 'I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress throughout this year. At this time, we are ready to take questions. So, Abigail, if you would like to get us started?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Hey, guys. This is James Picariello filling in for Jeff. Just a quick question on order trends. Can you speak to maybe the pace of what you're seeing through January and how that maybe compares to, in December and November?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"This is Jon. I think, James, the pattern is consistent with what we saw during Q2. I think what we're seeing in January is consistent with what we're seeing in guidance. January is, of course – the first two weeks of January are a little bit – very difficult to judge, but I think from what we can tell so far that we're consistent with the guidance that we've got together for Q3. So, nothing really remarkable to give you an answer on there.\", 'James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Okay. And just to follow-up. On Aerospace, what's the visibility in terms of the mix between OE and aftermarket for the back half? Just trying to get a better understanding for the margins?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, it would be, in general, we have good visibility for the OE, and the question is always in the aftermarket. What is included in our guidance is 65% OE, 35% aftermarket. That's what we've been running consistently for the last several quarters. There's a little bit of variation periodically, but that's what we're projecting here for the balance of the year.\", 'James A. Picariello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Thanks, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Nicole.', 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"So, I guess, I'll ask the question that someone's bound to ask is, can you guys go through your usual spiel on how the end markets progressed during the quarter?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"Nicole, this is Lee. Like I've done before in the past, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets and I'll also comment on our distribution channel.\", \"I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource driven markets, ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really by and large continue to be challenging everywhere around the world.\", \"So, starting off with North America, I think, oil and gas, in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Having said that, if I focus on distribution that doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas, we've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base that is still very difficult.\", \"Looking at, really, air conditioning, refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result, obviously, of the continued strengthening in the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf and then really an increase in product content which has to do with the SEER efficiency changes that incurred last year. So, we're really happy what's happening in those markets.\", 'Commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017.', \"And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which would be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth and this is really based on the markets but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment. So, very positive there.\", \"Touching back on North America oil and gas, as I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year 2016 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable in today's oil prices.\", 'Turning to agriculture, we continue to see topline declines, which is consistent I think in contraction and production schedules at our major customers. So, very weak on the agricultural equipment side.', 'On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects.', 'On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us. And it was excellent, but consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward.', 'On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business; the market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there.', \"And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive, our key North American distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus – Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders who cover this area. So that's North America.\", \"In Europe, there's – well, I'll comment on Europe. So, if I talk about distribution, weak overall with Q2 down versus last year. But, I think, what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really UK, Norway – it's up year-over-year. And we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution.\", \"We continue to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions and this is a highlight; if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries.\", \"Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill, looking at the UK capital investment, North Sea has dropped significantly. But, we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets. Really systems that eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies.\", 'Agriculture is still pretty much the same as North America, production rate is low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins for energy grid tie systems and it really is a complement to our growth and the Renewable Energy segments.', \"Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2.\", 'Turning to Asia, distribution as a total is flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy, of expanding our distribution points around the world. And we are doing that in the region.', \"Oil and gas, again, is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China and I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies, they still continue to invest, maybe at somewhat of a reduced rate.\", \"On energy, in the region, really I'm speaking to China mostly, renewable, wind, solar and hydro is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal powers, coal, gas, nuclear is still taking a major share.\", \"On rail, and this really speaks to China, we continue to be very bullish on the rail market; the Chinese government is making significant investments in this area. We've had – there is a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed rail, technology in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment, we continue to have strong participation across that rail market in China.\", \"On mobile construction, I can't say anything has progressed positive, since the last time we talked, there continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia-Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand.\", \"And then lastly, just talking to Latin America, it's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details. I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition and we've seen softness in all our end markets, mining, PowerGen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera.\", 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Okay. Thanks, Lee, that was really, really helpful.', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"So, just one quick follow-up, if you guys don't mind. So, on 3Q, you're guiding for $1.40 EPS at the midpoint. Typically, EPS steps up Q-on-Q. I know there were some below line puts and takes within the second quarter that are probably messing up that seasonality a bit. But I'm just curious are you guys embedding a deterioration in organic growth in 3Q compared to 2Q?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Let me start, Nicole. This is Tom. And I'll let Jon add on. What we did for the second half is basically we took the order entry that we saw that Lee described all the regions of the markets in the second quarter, which really, Aerospace orders got better, less negative, and Industrial North America got worse by three points and International got worse by two points. So, we took that order entry and basically translated that into the second half on an organic growth standpoint. So, our second-half organic growth from our previous guide used to be minus 5% and now it's minus 7.5%. So, we dropped it 2.5 points organically and then we have the second half coming at a minus 15% decremental MROS and that's how you get the second half EPS numbers.\", 'Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'll pass it on.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Your line is open.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', \"Let me just follow-up on Nicole's question and just clarify. As a clarification, what was the adjusted tax rate in the second quarter? And is the big difference between the third quarter and second quarter is a little bit of seasonality upturn being offset by a 28% tax rate assumption?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, first of all, the effective tax rate for the three months in Q2 was 20.3% and that's related to the passage of the extenders. Going forward into Q3, our run rate going forward is 28%, although it's just slightly higher in our Q3 that we've built in here due to a couple of items that we will account for it in the quarter, Eli.\", 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'Yeah. But that 28% versus the 20.3% is sort of like $0.12 to $0.15 or some number like that of the...', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', \"...difference in earnings and that almost accounts the difference between $1.52 and $1.40 that you're sort of forecasting for us.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. We are not – we are down – are down in the top line versus our old guidance in Q3 and we're also down commensurately at the operating income. But I've got, like I said, a slightly higher rate in Q3 due to some discrete items that we're accounting for in our tax rate there.\", 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', \"All right. And can we talk a little bit about the profitability, the lower profitability you're forecasting for the year? Most of that, I assume, is volume. Is there any changes in pricing going on in the marketplace? Are you able to hold pricing? I mean, we assume cost will continue to trend downward just because of the lower input costs. But can you a little bit, talk a little bit about what's going on in the – I assume the drop in margins that sort of are embedded it's like drop is a little volume related and that pricing looks like it's relatively stable in the industry?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Eli, this is Lee. I think the drop is all volume-related. Pricing has been flat. We forecasted it to be flat going forward.', 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'And input costs are still trending downward?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"They've been favorable.\", 'Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC', 'Yeah. All right. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.

Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Andy.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'A couple of questions related to your guidance. First, if we look back on Q2, can you give us the components of – there was quite a bit of difference between the initial $1.16 midpoint guidance and the reported $1.52. Understand tax was part of it. But what else changed?', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I mean, I think at the SG&A level for the quarter as Tom said, we've got some positive variance in the corporate G&A of about $18 million versus the prior guide. And that's due to the simplification efforts and a couple one-time adjustments that won't repeat. We've also got as compared to the prior guide, a small settlement of about $4 million for a contractual issue that we had in the other expense. That's about $4 million and that accounts for about $0.02.\", 'And, of course, Eli talked about the tax rate. And we had guided to a higher tax rate and again we did not know that the extenders was going to pass; and so of course, that turned out to be good news for us and that gave us $0.15 versus the prior guide.', 'And then at the operating income level, even with the reduced – projected reduced revenues, we were able to get approximately $15 million in additional operating income versus the prior guide on a slight beat in revenues.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thanks, Jon. And then on that $15 million, is that repeatable – that should carry through going forward?', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. Well, that is built into our guidance going forward and we feel very good about our cost structure and with the simplification efforts and our restructuring efforts are bringing for us and built into our guidance is additional savings that we're going to get from the restructuring efforts that we've been going through here in the first half of this year and at the end of last year.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thanks. And then a couple detail, I guess. First, on North American Industrial, did you see inventory destocking change during the quarter, meaning did it intensify, moderate or kind of stay the same versus the prior quarter?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"Andy, it's Lee. I would say it just stayed about the same. I mean at the end of the day it's really hard for us to get a gauge on that. But it certainly didn't get worse.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', \"Okay. Thanks, Lee. And then real quick on the last one, Aerospace outlook. Are you embedding the same sort of fourth-quarter bump up that you've seen in the last couple of years?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Andy, we really are not. What we've embedded in there is the continuation of the 35% MRO, 65% OEM at around the same relative profitability that we see right now. These last couple of years we've seen these one-time settlements get agreed to. And they have impacted the number so I understand completely your question. But that's not something that we would project in our guidance going forward here and so I don't really have any context for you on that point.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Hi. Good morning, everyone.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Morning, Ann.', 'Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Morning. You know, Don used to talk about the 3-12 and the 12-12. I'm just curious about the end markets that are really weak. Are you seeing any kind of an inflection point looking at your 3-12s and your 12-12s? Anything bottoming out there, particularly in North America?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"Ann, in all candor, I don't have my 3-12 and 12-12s in front of me. I can bring those back in the future. But, I would say the comps are going to start getting easier in some of those numbers, so it's just a matter of time. I mean obviously oil and gas, just from memory it is still decelerating. But, I would just be winging it here if I tried to give you any more context than that.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Ann, it's Tom. I think our assumption is there's really no meaningful recovery in the second half and what you see if you do the comparables it's just really easier comparables for us in the second half.\", 'Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate it. And then you did comment on customers talking about how weak the end markets are. Were you talking about distribution customers, particularly in oil and gas, or were you talking about OEMs? If you just could tell us what are the conversations like between OEMs versus your distribution?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"They are the same, quite frankly. Our distribution is involved with MRO but also with some projects, and handling it's very, very much the same. It's the same conversation.\", 'Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. I'll leave it there and let somebody else take it over. Thanks.\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.', 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, I know someone asked before on material costs and you said it was a benefit, but could you quantify what you're assuming for material costs and your guidance versus when you initially guided? Because I'm just trying to understand the decrementals that you guys are putting up, which have been much better than expected. I get that it's the simplification initiatives and restructuring as well.\", \"And then also, Tom, if you could just comment on the sustainability of sort of mid-to-high teen decremental margins. We haven't seen that before from Parker?\", \"And then my last question is just balance sheet; given the depressed markets you're seeing, are any – I know when we spoke last, you said valuations on acquisitions were still quite elevated. Has there been any change in the market? Thank you.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay, Jamie. This is Tom. So, I'll start with the material costs side. I would say compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the material side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us.\", \"And we feel good about this fiscal year, I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year in trying to tell you what the margin return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability.\", \"We've done it three quarters in a row, and I think for everybody on the phone to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did; all of the teams moved out very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment. Then we launched the simplification plan which really was more strategic restructuring, in addition to the footprint restructuring we were doing that enabled us to keep these very nice basically half of what we historically have done.\", \"And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the 2001 reduction – we were – the recession, it was a minus 60% MROS. The great recession was around minus 40% and here we are in that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low-20%s even reported all in. So, I think it's sustainable and that's what we have in the plan for the next two quarters.\", \"On the balance sheet, the acquisitions – the pipeline is active, but valuations are still high and I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from seller's expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think the time is on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that they – it's maybe not going to grow what they thought it was the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more line and I think our pipeline will become more actionable at that point. So, it's lumpy, it's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Sorry, Tom. One just quick follow-up on the simplification initiatives. Because as you look to 2017 there could be very high probability that things don't improve or that sales could decline. Based on what you're seeing with sort of the simplification initiatives, do you feel like you guys perhaps there's more there to do or you're realizing greater savings than you initially thought that again the sustainability of the decrementals could be better than what you originally thought?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, I think that is possible. I don't want to get above my skis for 2017. We'll talk about that in August. But, yes, I mean, what we've seen with sustainability for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring.\", \"The good thing about it, and just to remind people, there is four areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity so that's that tail of the revenue; we're looking at the bottom tail, that density of part numbers and (44:25) activity, just the cost to sustain that. We're very early days of getting into that. I mean that's a little more difficult for us to work but very early days of that.\", \"And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that, so that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it, so we're at 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll see us continue to work that.\", \"And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it. All the things that just slows things down, and that obviously carries cost and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where – what this could mean for us. And I think most everybody has seen the walk on taking us to 17% operating margins, simplification is the biggest bar on the walk. So, we clearly think there's more there.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"All righty, thanks. I'll get back in queue.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Thanks. Good morning, everyone.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Joe.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Tom, maybe staying on the simplification and restructuring spend for a second, it looks like the first couple of quarters, the spend is coming a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And so, I guess, my question is really just around your confidence on your ability to complete the actions this year and to get the roughly $70 million in benefits that you are expecting to receive from those actions. Any color there would be great.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Joe. It's Tom. So, our restructuring year-to-date is right on the money. So, we've forecasted 60% of the $100 million and we're at $57 million. So, we're very, very close to that number. And our savings are tracking and so I am very confident we're going to deliver both the cost that we had planned, the $100 million of cost and deliver the savings. And the savings is indicative of that is the marginal return on sales. We could not be delivering these kind of returns without the actions that we've taken, simplification being one of them that's helping us.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"Got it. So, yeah, maybe my numbers are off a little bit in the first half. I can follow up after the call. But, maybe one other key point is I noticed the free cash flow thus far has been pretty impressive and looks like this quarter working capital was a source of cash. I was wondering was there anything one-time or anything special – like I saw both the receivables and the inventory line down? Just curious what's driving the strong free cash flow.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Jon, here, Joe. We are very much focused on cash flow every single day here in the company here and watching as the top lines moves, what's going on there. All of our operating metrics are very good, nothing is deteriorating. We remain focused on the simplification efforts and our company is doing everything we can from a lean standpoint to improve every single process that we've got throughout the company. And we're seeing it in the cash flow statement. So, we're very proud of that.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones, Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Good morning, Tom, Jon, Lee.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Nathan.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Lee, in some of your comments about the end markets, you said that North American distribution was positive ex-oil and gas. I think our checks had indicated your North American distribution overall was down about 3%. Is that pretty close to right?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Total North American distribution?', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Yeah.', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Yeah. It would be down single-digits year-over-year.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"So, I think that implies that the direct channel from 2Q to – I'm sorry from 1Q to 2Q saw a fairly significant decline in the comp. Can you talk about any specific end markets that might have driven that?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"I want to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about our direct customers?\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Direct or OEM, the non-distribution channel.', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom. I'll chime in. What we saw in distribution in Q2 was primarily North America took a step down, but outside of North America it held up pretty well, Europe, Asia held up pretty nicely.\", 'So, the step down in North America really was indicative of the same step down we saw OEMs, which was the natural resource markets, a little bit of a knock-on into the general industrial space that knocked both distribution and the OEMs down. But, in general, OEMs have been down about two times what distribution has been down if you were to characterize the difference.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"Okay. That helps. And then with nine months to go on the original plan for $2 billion to $3 billion of share repurchase, it looks like you're kind of gliding into more of the low end of that. Is that keeping powder dry for some expected correction in the pricing in the M&A market for you and with an eye to getting perhaps more aggressive as we go forward on M&A?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Nathan, this is Tom. Good question. I'm sure this is on top of everybody's mind. So, we feel very good about what we've done so far. We're 87% of the way through to the low end of the $2 billion to $3 billion range.\", \"And maybe if I could just give a little color to the process that we – so every quarter, we sit down and it's really a cash allocation discussion. We look at cash generation capabilities, you know what do we think we're going to generate at closed-loop model taking a look at that. Where is the cash generated? What access do we have to the cash? And also with our goal that we'd like to maintain an A-rating as we go through this for a lot of good reasons.\", \"But on the deployment side, we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders comparing – recognizing, hey, we're going to do the dividends first. We're not going to move off of that, we're going to fund organic growth, but then we're going to look at the balance of share repurchase versus acquisitions to try to make that best decision.\", \"So, it's hard for me to give you a specific number that will land on the share repurchase, because it's really an opportunistic look weighing those various tugs and pulls every quarter as we go through that closed-loop model.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Fair enough. And if I could just go off the beaten path a little bit here, you talked about 2Q developing a comprehensive e-Business plan. And also talked a little bit more about development of the Internet of Things plan. Could you give us a little bit more color on where you are with that, how long the rollout looks to take and where the benefits come from that?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay, Nathan, this is Tom again. So, I'm going to start on e-Business and I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here, because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would, because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors in trying to help them be successful. Let me just suffice it to say that what we want on the e-Business side is we want a Google like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website.\", \"And we've launched a number of things that we think will get us there, it's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress we think over the last couple of years and as we talked to our customers and distributors they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there.\", \"So, we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remembering that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So, that's why we want this to be so important, we're investing in it, we made some organizational design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year.\", \"On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people are not familiar with what that is, it's basically an ideation process, where you gather ideas from around the company. And that coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all of the applications throughout the company, has really given us a program for ideas. So, we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon. We have narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best most commercial actionable projects. And we think that has got multimillion-dollar type of look – tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next three years. Most of that's not going to cut into probably towards the end of FY 2017 and FY 2018, it's probably going to take a year-and-a-half incubation here.\", \"We do have two good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them that the smart service kit, which is helping us in the refrigeration primarily the air-conditioning market, so if you take an air-conditioning contractor today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures and so this is a patented sensor that we have. It allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air-conditioning unit much more rapid, so the value for the contractors as many more calls happens during the call, they can get a print out right on their smartphone or visual on their smartphones and print it out if they want it for the customer, so they can see what's going on with their unit. So, we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales.\", \"And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go in – our check valves very sticky, but then our contractors absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you go to our website you can probably find a video of one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with BoA. Your line is open.', 'Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', 'Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Morning, Andrew.', 'Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', 'Hi. Can I just ask first just a very simple question? Did I hear it right that you highlighted automotive slowing or did I misheard that?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', 'Andrew, I was talking about in-plant automotive, so CapEx going into the plants.', 'Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', 'So, is that related to new platforms at OEs?', 'Lee C. Banks - President and Chief Operating Officer', \"I think there's been a – I'm not going to be that specific. But, what I've noticed is, there's been a lot of retooling activity with a lot of plants and some of that we're being told is going to start to slow down.\", 'Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', \"Got you. So, let's not count this question. But, are you guys getting any transaction benefit? I think a year-ago, you were talking about that it takes about a year to recertify some of the plants to ship stuff from Europe to the U.S. Are you doing it? Are you being able to do it? Are we seeing any benefit from this?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, Andrew, you know we are constantly trying to make sure that we're producing the right parts at the right locations and the right plants. And so we are not, from a transactional standpoint, getting hurt as bad as we would have been say this time last year in terms of the margins. So that is one piece of progress that we've been making, it is not – that's one of about 10 or 15 things that are going our way that are helping us with our margins and our decrementals.\", \"So, we don't see that getting bad. We're adjusting. It was this time last year where the euro and the Swiss franc decoupled and also when the dollar was really getting stronger. And so, we have adjusted to that where we stand right now today and that's what's built into our guidance going forward.\", 'Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', 'And just a question on capital allocation, given where the high-yield markets are, given that PE can no longer play, given where the stock prices are, how do you guys feel about your M&A funnel?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Andrew, it's Tom again. Same comments that I mentioned earlier about acquisitions that the valuations right now are still a little bit high. I think it's a little bit of a delayed effect as the seller's expectations on revenue hasn't come down to earth yet. But, time is on our side. They will come down and we continue those discussions. And what we've seen over time is eventually we come to the terms with better revenue forecast.\", \"We haven't taken action on some deals in the past mainly because of the difference in pricing and that pricing difference is primarily geared by differences in what we thought the revenue expectation was going to be for that business.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Abigail, if I could ask you please, if we could just have one more question, I see we're getting ready to run out of time here. So, thank you.\", 'Operator', 'Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.', 'Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)', \"Hi. How's it going?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good, Joel.', 'Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)', \"That's good. I'll make it quick. Is the run rate in your corporate G&A, is that the new level that we should be using going forward or is that a moving target that either got a benefit this quarter and is going to rise again or is it going to continue to structurally lower as we go forward?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"We're structurally going to be down slightly from our past run rate, but it was more of a couple one-time things in the corporate G&A. We're focused on about between $45 million to $48 million going forward here in the corporate G&A going forward as compared to in the mid-$50 million in Q1 and in prior years. So, this has some structural benefits from the simplification, but it would be wrong for me to not mention that there were some one-time items in Q2 for our G&A expense.\", 'Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)', \"Okay. And is there a big target on the business simplification? I think you used to have 240 divisions and now you mentioned it's down by 28. Is there any sort of a goal or is it just – it's going to end up where it naturally ought to be?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Joel, just to – it's Tom. To clarify, the number of divisions that we have operating divisions is 115. So, the 28 is in the 115. So, both Lee and I, the message we've left with the group presidents is we're looking for natural combinations that helps us just be more efficient, give us the scale that we need to better grow synergies and better cost synergies. We have some divisions that I think if we looked at it in hindsight had too much technology or product charter overlap, and it made more sense to put them together. So, it's not going to be one division. We still believe in a decentralized model. We still believe in driving that P&L ownership closest to our team members. But, I think you'll continue to see us do more in 2017 not at the rate that you saw us do in 2016.\", 'Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)', \"And is there a lot of other – this is the last one, sorry to take so long.

Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's second quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. To start, let me make a few summary comments.', 'It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We have tightened control of discretionary spending, reduced employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter.', 'Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental margin on return on sales for the past three quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end.', 'Moving on to specifics for the second quarter, sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4% and organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness.', 'Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis.', \"During the second quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure.\", \"In previous downturns, in which we've experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. The primary drivers of our margin performance include: savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods; immediate and decisive actions on cost containment; and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented.\", 'Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs.', 'Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%.', 'During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over two years, which began in October 2014.', 'Moving on to the discussion on key market trends, as projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas.', 'We continued to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail, and heavy-duty truck.', 'In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call.', 'Now switching to our outlook; for fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second-half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter.', 'We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy.', \"So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are: targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production; we're also targeting 17% segment operating margins; and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.\", 'We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top quartile company, compared with our proxy peers. Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings, and to leverage e-Business and Internet of Things capabilities.', \"During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-Business capabilities. We see opportunity to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy, grow our business and create a better customer experience. Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas.\", \"In summary, execution of the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top quartile performance versus our proxy peers. So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Tom.', \"And at this time, please refer to slide number five. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.\", \"On slide number six, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY 2015 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share.\", 'Increases to adjusted per-share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit.', 'Reductions to adjusted per-share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various one-time favorable adjustments were recognized.', 'Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter, total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year; there was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than plan, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter.', 'Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets.', \"Moving to slide number eight, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 1.3% in the quarter.\", 'Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets.', \"I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on slide number nine. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%.\", 'Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets.', \"I'll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales.\", 'Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.', 'Moving to slide number 11, with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency.', \"The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter-end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial's segments stemming from natural resource related end markets, as Tom mentioned.\", 'Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior-year comparables.', 'On slide number 12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year.', 'In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter, and we have $75 million for CapEx equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date.', 'Slide number 13, provides for FY 2016 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%.', 'Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY 2016.', 'For total Parker, adjustment segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category other is $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 137.1 million shares.', 'For the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.', 'Some additional key assumptions for full-year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 49%, first-half, 51% second-half; adjustment segment operating income is divided 49% first-half, 51% second-half; adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first-half and $3.06 in the second-half; Q3 FY 2016 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses.', \"On slide number 14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate, $0.13 from reduced corporate G&A, interest, and other, and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets.\", 'Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.', \"This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jon. We expect the difficult environment to continue through the rest of our fiscal year. As our margins here today indicate, we are responding well.

It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective.

Later, we will host a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.', 'Now I will hand the floor over to Jon Marten, Chief Financial Officer. Sir you have the floor.', 'Jon P. Marten', \"Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's third quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference.

Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's third quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we'll open the call for a Q&A.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Thanks Jon, good morning and welcome everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today we are going to cover four key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results. Second, some commentary on key market trends, give an update on the revised full-year guidance and finally I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives under New Win Strategy.\", 'So beginning with the third quarter results, sales declined 10.6% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5% and organic sales declined approximately by 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.', 'Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.', 'During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014. However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I’m very pleased to be delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis points improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.', 'During the third quarter, we delivered decrementals margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our team. This quarter remarks the 5', 'Year-to-date we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of the sales despite of $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishment by our team. Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker’s ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver less difficult financial performance.', 'So now a few brief comments on key end-markets, so reflecting on the order rates over the past year, we are encouraged with a point of moderating with the decline. More specifically from Q2 to Q3, we saw number of end-markets moved from what we would classify as accelerating decline to decelerating decline, which is a good sign.', 'We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends, we will provide you an update in our August call. As usual we will provide more details on our specific end-market during the Q&A portion of this call.', 'Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we’re increasing our guidance for earnings to the range $6.20, $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which resulted in earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint, increase can be attributed third quarter - and incremental savings we’re now seeing from the realignment actions we’ve taken year-to-date.', 'We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which for the full-year will go from a $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. As we move deeper into the New Win Strategy initiatives our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive front on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.', 'Now let me give you some highlights from the New Win Strategy, we continue to make meaningful progress with our one strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive over all growth and financial performance.', 'Let me take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas. Starting with safety, we’ve a 29% reduction in reportable injuries comparing to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year-ago on our rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety focused high performance teams.', 'Our goal is to reach zero accidents, the significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results. Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. The focus is on four key areas, revenue complexity, organization structure and process, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It’s a strategic revenue of our over head but also strategy review of our organization and process to improve our customers experience with Parker and also to only drive growth.', 'I’ll give you few examples with that. Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and products introduced for future growth. Our sales force organization we designed is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions. An another example, normally at this time of the year, we’re working through an extensive annual planning process.', 'This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. what used to five-months, now takes eight-weeks. In August we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.', 'Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize, I’ll give you a three examples on innovation front. Several years-ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive sensible gels to help cool delicate electronic components and mobile devices and automotive applications, such as closed room avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast growing markets. During the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive the FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology Indego.', 'Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals for spinal cord injury which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we’re positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than three-years an already generate initial sales in FY 2016.', 'Plan for launch next year is a C&G fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for class five to eight trucks. This module is a one-piece design that increases multiple products into a central compact system. We’re optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product. These examples showcases just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that creates vitality and growth from new products and technologies.', 'So in summary, by executing the New Win Strategy we are confident we’ll achieve our key financial objective by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of a 150 basis points higher and the rate of global industrial production. We’re also targeting [17%] (Ph) segment operating margins and progress total towards these goals is expected to drive in compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.', 'I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker top cortile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.', 'So for now, I’ll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Thanks Tom and at this time please refer to slide number five, I’ll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $151 versus $2.06 for the same quarter and year-ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and comparison $0.04 for the same quarter last year.', 'On the slide number six, you will find a significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 for the third quarter FY 2015 to a $51 for the third quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.', 'Reductions to adjusted per share income include other expense that total $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year in which last year sizeable one-time favorable currency adjustments were recognized lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end-market and $0.10 from increase effective tax rate driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.', 'Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter. Total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year, there was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact of reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.', 'Total company’s segment operating margins for the third quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end-market softness. Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of a reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end-markets.', 'Moving to slide number eight, I’ll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 0.8% in the quarter.', 'Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $236 million driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end-markets.', 'On slide number nine, I’ll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%, currency negative impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end-markets.', 'I’ll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible, sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year reflecting a combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the New Win Strategy.', 'Moving to slide number 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represented trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter-end, reflecting less negative quarter rates and Industrial segments and Aerospace segment or orders turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a positive 1% for the quarter.', 'Now turning to slide number 12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million, when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $81 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.', 'In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of dividends, $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in the Q3, $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.', 'The revised full-year earnings guidance for FY 2016 is outlined on slide number 13. Guidance is being provided on in adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share excluded expected business realignment charges or approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9 to negative 9.9 or negative 10.9 at the midpoint as compared to last year.', 'Adjusted organic growth as in midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacted sales by three, the majority of which is attributed to the industrial international segment. We have calculated the impact of currency the stock range as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the result in year-over-year impact for the balance of 2016.', 'For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint, this compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to those level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end-market declines.', 'The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full-year guidance is $137 million.', 'And for the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.', 'Slide number 14, you will find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases includes $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts, an increased savings from restructuring actions taken to-date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count.', \"The company's decision to increase full-year realignment cost to $120 million results in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.\", 'On slide number 15, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases included $0.18 and segment operating income and $0.08 from reduce corporate G&A, interest and share count.', 'This is partially offset by $0.06 increased in other expense and taxes. Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared comments.', \"Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Thanks Jon. I’m very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members around the world. We are well in the challenges of our end-markets and delivering impressive performance. Our team is embracing changes design to improve Parker and positions for the future under the framework of the New Win Strategy. Together we are building a stronger and better Parker, I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress.', 'And at this time, we are going to take questions. So Brian, if you could just get us started.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'My pleasure [Operator Instruction] We ask an interest of time that you please limit yourself to one preliminary question and one follow-up [Operator Instruction] Our first question is from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'Jamie Cook', \"Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, Tom, I guess everyone is interested in sort of the order sales trends that you saw throughout the first quarter and potentially what you are seeing in the month of April. Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seeing some green shoots without being too optimistic? And then I guess just my second question to you is, with one quarter left - in the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we are thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough restructuring given your view on the markets that we just have to execute on what's already out there, or could there be potential for more as we think about 2017? Thanks.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Okay Jamie this is Tom. So I’ll start first with order trends. So orders during the quarter sequentially got better as we saw January going through March, and obviously what we saw in April is consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I finish all my comment and will let Lee give you some deeper color, but I made the comment about that we saw a number of markets move from accelerating declined to decelerating declined.', \"So I think the theme of what we are seeing is this moderation of decline and the movers from accelerating to decelerating have really lead to charge or distribution general industrial ag, mining and similar account and you asked for some of a positive markets. The positive markets are refrigeration and air conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial MRO and powergen. and now I'll let Lee go into more details in a minute on all the market color.\", 'On the restructuring we moved to from a $100 million and $120 million and just to clear the year for people listening on the phone, this isn’t because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we need to do this. It really was we saw more opportunities as we started unpeel the New Win Strategy being implemented within the company, there were just more opportunities that our team members around the world identified in traditional restructuring and simplification and et cetera, that we thought would be a very good to take now and that will put us in good position in FY 2017.', \"But you asked about 2017, now in my opening comments I talked about we moved this to an eight-week process, we are only three-weeks into it, so I won't comment about 2017, as you might imagine commenting about 2017 in April is harder than commenting about it in August. However, I will you give some color on the restructuring.\", \"So restructuring is year I would call a high watermark, $120 million and if you looked at us traditionally before kind of the restructuring we've done over the last several years, we are more in that $20 million $25 million range. Now well the restructuring is not finalized, what we think next year and we are only about half way through our reviews, I think we are looking at something that’s in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and $120 million that we did this year. So that’s my take in your comments Jamie, if it’s okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets which I'm sure other people on the phone have questions as well.\", 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay great.', 'Lee C. Banks', 'Okay, hi Jamie. So as Tom talked about sequentially total Parker organic growth moved to a better direction during the quarter. if you look at it, it was widely a result of North America followed by EMEA. I’m going to walk you through the different regions and try and give you as much color as I can.', \"So starting with North America industrial distribution, total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY 2016. Now this is mostly as we've talked about in past impacted by oil and gas, so we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets which has really been a drag for distribution, its most aligned with those end-markets. If you get away from that we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes. Mid West areas and cover auto plants, Tier-1 machines all these et cetera. So it’s certainly a couple of different tails depending to the story depending on where you are in the country.\", \"Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration that’s really a bright spot for us, we continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth much of that growth can be attributed to some product introduction we've done, it's really given us a strong market participation. Our commercial air conditioning refrigeration businesses that’s up low single-digits and our aftermarket business organically with the market with some new product introductions that continues to be real strong.\", \"The story around oil and gas, I guess major OEMs really continue to indicating no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016 early 2017 and this is really massive and I'm sure you have covered this restructuring plans taking place. It looks like everybody is trying to restructure and look to be profitable around $40 per barrel.\", \"And we looked at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig markets for new builds could take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner, but on the positive side you have heard us talk about this, we continue increase demand for some of our aftermarket service capability such as our Parker Tracking System that enables asset integrity management of field and we've had good traction with that.\", 'On agriculture, we expect sales of farm equipment down industry wide and our demand continues to be consistent with that. By focusing on energy, we continue to increase our market position with large frame turbine OEMs and this has been a plus because there continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. so it has allowed us to participate in that. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business, it did get a boos with the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended so that was a positive for us in the quarter.', 'Turning to heavy truck in North America, current forecast, ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast and our North America transportation business is down high single-digits better than industry build rate declines and I would attribute this to some new product introduction. And really our aftermarket exposures there kind of softens some of that down turn.', \"On the mobile markets, I think a real positive Tom mentioned turf, its North American central market but continues to be a real strong highlight for us and then with all the major construction equipment that continues to experience top-line decline. But there does seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And the in plant automotive, really this is a key North American distribution that covers that and we're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there.\", 'Just touching on Europe distribution trends are consistent with really last quarter distribution side, the industrial MRO automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive and then anything tied to oil and gas as I mentioned before continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us really contained in our Win Strategy initiatives is distribution is up in emerging markets Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single-digits, combination of organic growth within the region, but cost effective increased market participation by us.', \"Oil and gas demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment and that really still is a bit of a standstill, but then again this is another area where we've had some really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at a first fit level. And then on Ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now I would call an increase in normal seasonality.\", 'On heavy truck stronger demand continues in the quarter and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2, we saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And mobile demand is stabilized at current activity level. We did have a large exhibitive at the recent [indiscernible] show and I think all of us were encouraged by one of the attendance, but also the favorable settlement taking place at the show. So may it gives us some freedom to do somewhat positive going forward.', \"Turning to Asia now, really distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year, China is the biggest issue, it’s the most sluggish it’s down high single-digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we’re up across the region, I give this a lot of credit to what our guys are doing on expansion and we've talked to you about such as [indiscernible] in some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there.\", \"Energy across the region, we still seeing increased activity and renewable which wind solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal, gas and nuclear store taking the major share and we are participating in those. We always talked about, Tom mentioned that is an accelerating growth, it continues to be great story, we've commented for some time on the strengths of this in market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder, we’ve recently signed high speed rail contracts with Laos, Thailand and Indonesia and we continue to have strong exposure to build rails.\", 'And then on mobile construction, we have seen some modest growth in China and I have heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that for the most part, the OEM inventory is still extremely high, so I think it will take some time for us to see that but our business has stabilized in current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America, I think it’s really dominative by the Brazil story, our construction equipment, Ag markets, etcetera is still very soft.', 'But there is decent activity if you get outside Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really dwarfed by Brazil. So taking all together total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as resulted of I mentioned North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining and the words that keep coming to our minds to describe what we’re seeing on a year-over-year basis.', 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay, thank you. I’ll get back in queue.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open please go ahead.', 'Joseph Ritchie', \"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first question is around the restructuring actions. I know it's hard to comment much at this point on 2017, but it seems like the payback that you got on these actions, the additional realignment actions, is really good. I guess my question is how are you thinking about - when you are thinking about the magnitude of restructuring for next year, how are you thinking about the potential payback and is it going to be mostly headcount-related?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Jo, this is Tom. So, on the restructuring I would just say in general, we’re really pleased with our team, team around the world. The execution has been timely, we've been thoughtful on how we've done it and I'm just very proud of how the team has performed on the restructuring and that’s been a big part of the timeliness and that has been a big part of what's helped our margins perform this year.\", \"As far as next year, we’re going through, I still think my characterization would be somewhere between the $120 million to $120 million to $125 million, is probably a good indicator. I still think that for the most part as restructuring is a pretty good payback from a time period standpoint, usually the 12-month indicator obviously it’s in a more traditional or international orientated type of restructuring, will take longer, probably 18-month to 24-months. But in general it would still be aimed at the more strategic restructuring that we've been talking about which is at the forehead of the company, but we’ll continue to look at as we just traditionally have the footprint optimization as it makes sense.\", 'Joseph Ritchie', \"Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, Tom, your comments earlier about going from an accelerating to a decelerating decline, I'm just curious within that context what's going on with the pricing environment? Are you seeing any pressure across the portfolio today? Have you started to see stabilization there as well, just curious? Any color there would be helpful.\", 'Lee C. Banks', 'Joe this is Lee, I’ll just give you some comments on that. So I would characterize price realization is very tough candidly. We did raise prices to distribution in this past January, its mostly around non-core and late lifecycle type of products, but we did realize price there. But one thing we do track and you’ve heard us talk about this in the past, we have an SPI Index which tracks year-over-year pricing by partner. And we have a PPI which tracks our input costs. And we do have a positive spread here and we look at continuously. So I would say if you had to characterizes overall, it’s pretty much flat.', 'Joseph Ritchie', 'And Lee, is that spread mostly being driven by the denominator? Is it just because the cost environment has remained favorable and could that potentially reverse itself as we progress through the year??', 'Lee C. Banks', 'I would say top-line, the SPI number is flat, as I talked about, but the PPI is giving us the spread, yes.', 'Joseph Ritchie', 'Okay, great. Thanks guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Good morning, Jeff.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Just on the buyback, it looks like it slowed here a little bit and M&A has kind of been weak. I just thought as we come on the deadline for this $2 billion to $3 billion, we would be tracking more towards the high end. Maybe just update us on how you are thinking about buyback?', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Jeff, this is Tom. So in the buyback, we continue to look at that on a dynamic basis, looking at what makes the most sense for our shareholders and obviously, we’ll update you every quarter. But some things to just keep in mind from consideration. When you look at our cash that’s on the balance sheet 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. It’s important to us to maintain A rating, so that’s a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out $2 billion to $3 million initiatives that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then and now we were $11.3 billion.', 'So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continues to do very well at 10.5%. We’re going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can, we look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active, but it’s always hard to predict the output there, it tends to be lumpy.', 'But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit, but we’re disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in spaces that we understand. And we understand the growth rates, so we’ll continue to be that way. But I think you’ll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment of cash as we possibly can weighing all the variables to try to do the best thing we can on the long-term behalf of the shareholders.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', \"Okay. That's helpful. And then it looks like the guide is mostly North America feeling a little bit better and I think you mentioned some of the restructuring. But just go into a little more detail on what is surprising you to the upside in the North America business?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Well, Jeff, I think Lee probably did a pretty good job of taking you all through that, but in North America, when you look at it sequentially, almost everything was positive in North America. Some of that we get just from the calendar helping us, but in particular the part that I like is that when you look at - in case people don’t understand what I’m talking about these market phases, so you have got accelerating growth and decelerating growth and you have got accelerating decline and decelerating decline. And if I was to show you this dot map of our end-markets in these four phases and if you look at it in Q2, you could see a lot of dots in the accelerating decline.', 'And what’s moved and I would say in particular in North America, it’s been distribution, Ag, semicon, mining, general industrial, but I think the thing we are cautious about is that I think we are getting help from comps for the most part and that at this point still too early, I think to say that there is a general market shifts. So we’re going to continue to look at that data, we need a few more months and another quarter or two to help confirm that.', 'But in the healing process of order entry, step one is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline, so that’s the good thing we are very happy about that. And to put up the kind of numbers we are putting up in this kind of climate I think if you look at us historically is remarkable. And I’ve told a lot of people, when we get to flat, you are going to love the numbers, because flat will be the new high and then we’ll continue to grow from there.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Yes, but on the margin front, is that just greater traction on some of the restructuring, or what really drove the guidance or vision on North America margins??', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'I’m sorry, Jeff. I thought you were talking about sales, but, yes, on margins, it was clearly the return on the restructuring and the simplification actions. We’ve seen faster return and just more effective cost savings.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Okay thanks a lot Tom.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Good morning. Can I touch back on the share repurchases? Traditionally you have always talked about having your own internal model, which you use to determine how much shares you think you should buy back or not. With the $50 million buyback, was your model telling you that Parker shares were fairly valued in the quarter?', 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Ann, it's Tom. It's always a good time to buy Parker shares. We just looked at - again it's fair to looking at all the opportunities and opportunities we can't share all opportunities with it. When we look at all the opportunities we thought the amount that we did was the right amount. We will continue to look at every quarter, we wave obviously dividends first, investment for organic growth.\", 'And if you look at the balance between acquisitions and share repurchase i.e. For the reasons I talked about earlier would be an indicator why we are going to be at the low end of that range because the dynamics of the world have changed once we announce that proposal. We are absolutely committed to the low end of that range, I don’t want anybody to misunderstand me, but things have changed as far as we look at to the top end of the range. The balance above that is all depending on what is the best use of cash for our shareholders.', 'Ann Duignan', \"Right. That's very helpful clarification. And then my follow-up is back to some of the comments you made about restructuring the sales force. We get nervous when we hear other companies talking about restructuring the sales force. It doesn't always work out very well. Could you just give us a little bit more detail on what you are doing there and how comfortable you feel about the progress you are making?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Yes Ann, this is Tom again. We are very, very happy with what we are doing there. I can understand your reservations, but this was done with a lot of thought and here they change, so our groups are organized with exception Aerospace organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our division that they can find the people that own those income products and technologies.\", 'So in Europe as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated on alignment at the markets to being more products centric was still not giving at the markets having that they have lesser concentration or more concentration on technologies and markets, so that we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify interface with the global OEMs with our regional OEMs is in Europe as we now have a 10 Europe OEM teams, which is very similar to what we had in North America, which had someone to access.', 'So we had that two, because it didn’t make sense to be calling on OEMs country-by-country that span the entire Europe. So that’s been in place, in probably six-months to nine-months and we are very incurred with the kind of market share actions that we are seeing coming out of that from that team. And then just in Japan that was the other example that comes in my mind when I made that comment.', 'In Japan if you look at us historically, we had a very fragmented sales force, we now have a sales force that is all aligned that is kind of because of the combination of acquisitions that we had in joint ventures years-ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment on the operating side and we are seeing the results that Japan is doing very well for us. So the organization changes to give you comfort are showing in the numbers and in the market concentrations, so we go account-by-account in various regions.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay. Thank you so much. I will leave it there and get back in line. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'David Raso', \"Apologies in advance. I've been hopping between a few calls. But quite simply, looking at the rate of businesses that you have right now and their various growth rates and not thinking of any change, but incorporating seasonality, when would you expect your organic sales to be back to flat?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Dave it's Tom again. So that is of course the question everybody would like to know and at this point it's difficult for me to predict. And I won't try to predict that I mean at this point our guidance for the fourth quarter is a minus seven organically, so that’s was a improvement from the minus 9.4 we had in Q3. So that’s the first good sign and like I said in these market phase is when we look at all the markets, we went from a concentration in accelerating decline to now more than move decelerating decline.\", \"We would hope to keep moving kind of clockwise around these phases and start to moving to some kind of growth. But I think it's too early to - honestly we haven’t given indicator of that we would tell you when. Few more data points, couple more months and couple more quarters obviously we are going to be in much better position to tell you, but I would say this with the first step in the hilling.\", 'David Raso', \"Okay. That's fine. Just wanted to get your perspective on that. Thank you.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Your line is now open, please ahead.', 'Eli Lustgarten', 'Good morning, everyone. Can we talk a little bit about where inventory levels are both in the distribution sense and the OEM the best you can [indiscernible]. Are we really passed all the inventory organization, or is there still some going on? And with the pricing, you raised prices at distribution, but we keep hearing distribution people are having trouble passing anything on. Are they taking the price increase and absorbing it, or are they able to pass it through?', 'Lee C. Banks', 'Eli it’s Lee. I was expecting this inventory destocking, so I researched this 10 times before this call. So here is the consensus when I checked this not only from our guys and then I just go out and cal our contacts. If you are involved in oil and gas and you had a lot of OEM exposure, you are still sitting on a lot of inventory. If you get away from that inventory is pretty much normalized at this point in time. I think some of the guys may have gotten hit a little bit by some side effects from oil and gas, but that’s fairly normalized.', \"I would say on OEM inventory where I still see this kind of construction equipment, mining markets especially Asia comes to mind. If you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean there is just excavators and wheel loaders that go on for miles so. But our North American distribution, I'm most comfortable that outside of oil and gas, it’s not a big issue.\", 'And then your second question on pricing, I can’t really comment on that. What we did there was really non-core, so I can’t really comment too much on that. I have not had any feedback that it’s been a big issue. If anything, it’s been positive with our [indiscernible].', 'Eli Lustgarten', 'Alright. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', 'Hi. Good morning guys.', 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Good morning, Josh.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', \"Just maybe to ask Raso's question a little differently. On the orders front, you guys can obviously see the comp getting easier there, orders quarterly down a little bit more than maybe the comp was, got easier this quarter. Is there a potential for orders to get back to flat in June, understanding that it may be a while longer before sales quite get there?\", 'Jon P. Marten', 'Josh, Jon here just to be responsive to your question. Of course, we are not calling for that in our guidance going forward. When you take a look at the orders overall for Parker, we are just looking at - we were at this time last year down four and we were down nine, down 11, down 12, now we are down six. So the question is what is the rate of the incline in the reduction of the orders for the company.', 'We don’t have that forecasted or we’re going to be looking at that very closely, it’s going to be fully aligned with the end market progress that Lee and Tom have been making. And we are gaining market share, we are launching the end markets. And as Tom said, I think our best characterization is that it’s a moderately decline and obviously moderating. But we’ll coming out with that answer when we do our guidance in August. But right now in April, it’s a little too early to give you a very detailed answer to that.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', \"Okay. And then just to revisit the buyback discussion. It sounded like maybe there were some mitigating factors in the quarter that stayed your hand, but is there a period of time that passes when some of those other opportunities go away or aren't actionable, or are actionable and you guys are left with buyback, or is this something that is a little bit more structural in nature? Just trying to get the overall strategy there maybe versus like a one-quarter event.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Yes. Well, the overall strategy hasn’t change. We want to be great generators of cash and great deployers of cash. And I think the generators of cash, the Win Strategy continue to work that aggressively with the changes that we’ve made we are 10.5% now. We like being that and we would like to work that even higher. And we are going to do that through continue to grow our operating earnings and continue to working capital down.', 'On the deployment, it’s the same priorities that I’ve mentioned. It’s just trying to make the businesses and I wouldn’t read one thing to aggressively into one quarter on this. The buyback announcement is going to expire and my preferences to tell you every quarter what we are doing as appose to making some big announcements what we are going to do from the period going forward.', 'There are some natural considerations given the amount of cash that’s permanently invested overseas, our desire to keep an A rating and the fact this program was rolled out two-years ago, and a lot has changed two-years, or approximately two-years ago. But we like all those avenues and we want to be as deploying cash as we are great at generating the cash, and I would look for us to do that. And I can’t show you everything that we see, but we’ll continue to do the best we can on behalf of the shareholders for what we think is best long-term.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', 'Alright. Thanks again.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You mentioned mining as showing decelerating declines. Can you help us on whether that was related to shipments into OEMs or an MRO comment?', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'I think on the mining, what we saw in generals that probably a little bit more help on the, I would say it would be both. OEM in general comparing Q2 to Q3 got a little bit better distribution got a little better as well, but for the most part it’s probably more the comps that are helping us at this point. We’re not ready to declare a victory in any of these areas, get a couple of more quarters and we see this move then I think we already say it’s more than markets, at this point it’s probably the comps helping us more than anything.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Okay thank you Tom and then if you cover this, I missed it I apologize on the incremental $85 million benefit you expect during this year from restructuring in simplification, how much have you realized year to data and if you can give it in the quarter?', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Yes Andy of the $85 million that is we are expecting $40 million of that in our Q4 so $65 million for the second half, $85 million for the year of the second half $42 million in Q4.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Okay and then thank you Jon and that should that step up, kind of continue into the next fiscal year or would you expect with the additional restructuring that you kind alluded to it have even more it’s step up kind of back half loaded next year?', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Yes there is no doubt that the savings that we’re getting from this year we’re carefully carry through for a period of time into next year and it’s too early for me to give you too much color on the numbers that the Tom was referring to early in his comments about the restructuring and the savings that we get for next year. So I don’t want to give you an answer to that would be misleading, I just wanted to kind of tell you that clearly we are not going to taking a step back for saving that we’re getting on, its permanent that is going to be a very helpful tailwind for us for next year.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Thank you Andy.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from lines of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. please go ahead.', 'Nathan Jones', 'Good morning, everyone. Can we just clarify on that last point, $40 million restructuring savings in 4Q. So is $160 million annually the new run rate that you are looking at from the $120 million, or should it be a little bit higher than that?', 'Jon P. Marten', 'I do not think it’s going be higher than that. It’s not going to be $40 million for quarter going forward here Nathan. So I want to research that one further here but that’s just the way that we calculate the savings here based on the restructuring that we’ve done year-to-date and that would - be most of the restructuring of course that we’re doing in Q4 the actual restructuring is going to give us savings next year.', 'Nathan Jones', 'Okay. If I could get into North American margins from a different angle here, on a year-over-year basis for the quarter you just reported, organically, you lost about $200 million of revenue. All else equal, I would think the decrementals on that should be somewhere in the vicinity of 25%. So you started about $50 million in the hole on operating income and you are up about $25 million. So from other avenues, you gained about $75 million of operating income. Could you bucket the main places that that came from, where the savings came from, what is improved execution, what is productivity, those kinds of things?', 'Jon P. Marten', \"Well certainly I can’t detail it down to you for dollar, but as Tom and Lee had talked about the productivity that we’re saying from the New Win Strategy is a significant portion of that number Nathan and as we apply the techniques that we've known for years and the ones that we’re really focusing on here with the New Win Strategy, we’re seeing margins in a declining environment that we’ve never seen before.\", \"And so what gratified by that as significant portion is just additional incremental productivity that’s not necessarily you know to take the place of the savings that I’ve been taking about when we do those simplification efforts or the restructuring efforts that we've done in the company.\", 'So I can’t detail it down to you, dollar-by-dollar, but what is happening with the margins and the reason why our decrementals are so impressive is because of the dedication of our employees to rebuild our efforts on productivity in the company and our ability to get savings from the restructuring that we’ve done you know in the past year.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Yes, they were really very impressive. Just one for Lee. Lee, you talked about mobile OEM China inventory. This is an issue we've been dealing with for probably going on five years from the overstimulation coming out of the last recession in China. Any attempt at guessing when that inventory may clear?\", 'Lee C. Banks', 'You know to be clear with you, there does seem to be some positive sentiment with some of the stimulus that the Chinese government is trying to use, but it’s way too early to tell on that.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Okay. That's fair. Thanks very much.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Brian, I see that we are at the top of the hour, so we could just take one more question, please.', 'Operator', 'My pleasure. Our last question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.', 'Joseph Giordano', \"Thanks for sneaking me in here. Quick on the decrementals, kind of like what Nathan hinted at, when I'm comparing North America to international and granted both are - decrementals have been great on both pieces of those businesses - but we are seeing more pronounced organic declines on a year-on-year basis in North America, but margin is actually going up, so can you walk us through what maybe the different types of initiatives going on, on the restructuring side between the two segments as to what might be driving even more pronounced decremental reductions in North America?\", 'Jon P. Marten', 'Yes. Joe sure, just real quick on a top level, although we’re down higher organically and you are absolutely right, in the North America than we are in international, our decremental MROS on an adjusted basis is 13 for North America versus about 19. Now in any environment that 19 in our history, in our company is a very impressive number. But it is distinguished from North America, I believe it has something to do with the level and depth of some of the restructuring that we’re doing a little bit of the quicker payback in restructuring in North America versus internationally. But in both cases, we’re making great progress and we’re kind of - we are seeing a little bit of difference, but this historically in North America and in our industrial businesses.', 'The best we’ve ever done in the downturn like this especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we’re talking of a negative nine, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative seven here coming up. So the short answer is very quick actions, quick recovery, dedication on the part of our management teams both in internationally and in North America and our ability to be resilient and adaptable as a company today versus maybe in some of the prior downturns in the past periods.', 'Joseph Giordano', 'Great. And then just last for me, in terms of scale, maybe you could put this in the appropriate context for us on the simplification efforts and removing of divisions, things like that. How many SKUs have you guys gotten rid of on a percentage basis or something just to give us a sense of how much this has really changed??', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Yes, this is Tom. That will be very difficult to answer. I couldn’t even hazard I could guess. But just recognize that we are working at last couple of percent of revenue. It does carry a disproportionate amount of costs and part numbers and quote activity and that’s the focus. But I couldn’t you give you a guess on that amount.', 'Joseph Giordano', 'Alright good enough. Thanks guys.', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. This is all the time we have for questions and answers today. Thank you for your participation on today’s call. You may now disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.']","2016","', 'Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Corp. Quarter Three 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will host a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.', 'Now I will hand the floor over to Jon Marten, Chief Financial Officer. Sir you have the floor.', 'Jon P. Marten', \"Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's third quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference.

Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's third quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we'll open the call for a Q&A.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Thanks Jon, good morning and welcome everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today we are going to cover four key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results. Second, some commentary on key market trends, give an update on the revised full-year guidance and finally I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives under New Win Strategy.\", 'So beginning with the third quarter results, sales declined 10.6% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5% and organic sales declined approximately by 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.', 'Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.', 'During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014. However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I’m very pleased to be delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis points improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.', 'During the third quarter, we delivered decrementals margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our team. This quarter remarks the 5', 'Year-to-date we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of the sales despite of $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishment by our team. Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker’s ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver less difficult financial performance.', 'So now a few brief comments on key end-markets, so reflecting on the order rates over the past year, we are encouraged with a point of moderating with the decline. More specifically from Q2 to Q3, we saw number of end-markets moved from what we would classify as accelerating decline to decelerating decline, which is a good sign.', 'We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends, we will provide you an update in our August call. As usual we will provide more details on our specific end-market during the Q&A portion of this call.', 'Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we’re increasing our guidance for earnings to the range $6.20, $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which resulted in earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint, increase can be attributed third quarter - and incremental savings we’re now seeing from the realignment actions we’ve taken year-to-date.', 'We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which for the full-year will go from a $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. As we move deeper into the New Win Strategy initiatives our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive front on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.', 'Now let me give you some highlights from the New Win Strategy, we continue to make meaningful progress with our one strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive over all growth and financial performance.', 'Let me take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas. Starting with safety, we’ve a 29% reduction in reportable injuries comparing to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year-ago on our rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety focused high performance teams.', 'Our goal is to reach zero accidents, the significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results. Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. The focus is on four key areas, revenue complexity, organization structure and process, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It’s a strategic revenue of our over head but also strategy review of our organization and process to improve our customers experience with Parker and also to only drive growth.', 'I’ll give you few examples with that. Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and products introduced for future growth. Our sales force organization we designed is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions. An another example, normally at this time of the year, we’re working through an extensive annual planning process.', 'This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. what used to five-months, now takes eight-weeks. In August we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.', 'Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize, I’ll give you a three examples on innovation front. Several years-ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive sensible gels to help cool delicate electronic components and mobile devices and automotive applications, such as closed room avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast growing markets. During the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive the FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology Indego.', 'Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals for spinal cord injury which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we’re positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than three-years an already generate initial sales in FY 2016.', 'Plan for launch next year is a C&G fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for class five to eight trucks. This module is a one-piece design that increases multiple products into a central compact system. We’re optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product. These examples showcases just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that creates vitality and growth from new products and technologies.', 'So in summary, by executing the New Win Strategy we are confident we’ll achieve our key financial objective by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of a 150 basis points higher and the rate of global industrial production. We’re also targeting [17%] (Ph) segment operating margins and progress total towards these goals is expected to drive in compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.', 'I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker top cortile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.', 'So for now, I’ll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Thanks Tom and at this time please refer to slide number five, I’ll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $151 versus $2.06 for the same quarter and year-ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and comparison $0.04 for the same quarter last year.', 'On the slide number six, you will find a significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 for the third quarter FY 2015 to a $51 for the third quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.', 'Reductions to adjusted per share income include other expense that total $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year in which last year sizeable one-time favorable currency adjustments were recognized lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end-market and $0.10 from increase effective tax rate driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.', 'Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter. Total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year, there was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact of reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.', 'Total company’s segment operating margins for the third quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end-market softness. Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of a reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end-markets.', 'Moving to slide number eight, I’ll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 0.8% in the quarter.', 'Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $236 million driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end-markets.', 'On slide number nine, I’ll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%, currency negative impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end-markets.', 'I’ll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible, sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year reflecting a combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the New Win Strategy.', 'Moving to slide number 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represented trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter-end, reflecting less negative quarter rates and Industrial segments and Aerospace segment or orders turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a positive 1% for the quarter.', 'Now turning to slide number 12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million, when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $81 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.', 'In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of dividends, $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in the Q3, $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.', 'The revised full-year earnings guidance for FY 2016 is outlined on slide number 13. Guidance is being provided on in adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share excluded expected business realignment charges or approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9 to negative 9.9 or negative 10.9 at the midpoint as compared to last year.', 'Adjusted organic growth as in midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacted sales by three, the majority of which is attributed to the industrial international segment. We have calculated the impact of currency the stock range as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the result in year-over-year impact for the balance of 2016.', 'For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint, this compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to those level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end-market declines.', 'The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full-year guidance is $137 million.', 'And for the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.', 'Slide number 14, you will find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases includes $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts, an increased savings from restructuring actions taken to-date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count.', \"The company's decision to increase full-year realignment cost to $120 million results in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.\", 'On slide number 15, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases included $0.18 and segment operating income and $0.08 from reduce corporate G&A, interest and share count.', 'This is partially offset by $0.06 increased in other expense and taxes. Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared comments.', \"Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Thanks Jon. I’m very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members around the world. We are well in the challenges of our end-markets and delivering impressive performance. Our team is embracing changes design to improve Parker and positions for the future under the framework of the New Win Strategy. Together we are building a stronger and better Parker, I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress.', 'And at this time, we are going to take questions. So Brian, if you could just get us started.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'My pleasure [Operator Instruction] We ask an interest of time that you please limit yourself to one preliminary question and one follow-up [Operator Instruction] Our first question is from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'Jamie Cook', \"Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, Tom, I guess everyone is interested in sort of the order sales trends that you saw throughout the first quarter and potentially what you are seeing in the month of April. Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seeing some green shoots without being too optimistic? And then I guess just my second question to you is, with one quarter left - in the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we are thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough restructuring given your view on the markets that we just have to execute on what's already out there, or could there be potential for more as we think about 2017? Thanks.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Okay Jamie this is Tom. So I’ll start first with order trends. So orders during the quarter sequentially got better as we saw January going through March, and obviously what we saw in April is consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I finish all my comment and will let Lee give you some deeper color, but I made the comment about that we saw a number of markets move from accelerating declined to decelerating declined.', \"So I think the theme of what we are seeing is this moderation of decline and the movers from accelerating to decelerating have really lead to charge or distribution general industrial ag, mining and similar account and you asked for some of a positive markets. The positive markets are refrigeration and air conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial MRO and powergen. and now I'll let Lee go into more details in a minute on all the market color.\", 'On the restructuring we moved to from a $100 million and $120 million and just to clear the year for people listening on the phone, this isn’t because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we need to do this. It really was we saw more opportunities as we started unpeel the New Win Strategy being implemented within the company, there were just more opportunities that our team members around the world identified in traditional restructuring and simplification and et cetera, that we thought would be a very good to take now and that will put us in good position in FY 2017.', \"But you asked about 2017, now in my opening comments I talked about we moved this to an eight-week process, we are only three-weeks into it, so I won't comment about 2017, as you might imagine commenting about 2017 in April is harder than commenting about it in August. However, I will you give some color on the restructuring.\", \"So restructuring is year I would call a high watermark, $120 million and if you looked at us traditionally before kind of the restructuring we've done over the last several years, we are more in that $20 million $25 million range. Now well the restructuring is not finalized, what we think next year and we are only about half way through our reviews, I think we are looking at something that’s in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and $120 million that we did this year. So that’s my take in your comments Jamie, if it’s okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets which I'm sure other people on the phone have questions as well.\", 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay great.', 'Lee C. Banks', 'Okay, hi Jamie. So as Tom talked about sequentially total Parker organic growth moved to a better direction during the quarter. if you look at it, it was widely a result of North America followed by EMEA. I’m going to walk you through the different regions and try and give you as much color as I can.', \"So starting with North America industrial distribution, total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY 2016. Now this is mostly as we've talked about in past impacted by oil and gas, so we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets which has really been a drag for distribution, its most aligned with those end-markets. If you get away from that we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes. Mid West areas and cover auto plants, Tier-1 machines all these et cetera. So it’s certainly a couple of different tails depending to the story depending on where you are in the country.\", \"Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration that’s really a bright spot for us, we continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth much of that growth can be attributed to some product introduction we've done, it's really given us a strong market participation. Our commercial air conditioning refrigeration businesses that’s up low single-digits and our aftermarket business organically with the market with some new product introductions that continues to be real strong.\", \"The story around oil and gas, I guess major OEMs really continue to indicating no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016 early 2017 and this is really massive and I'm sure you have covered this restructuring plans taking place. It looks like everybody is trying to restructure and look to be profitable around $40 per barrel.\", \"And we looked at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig markets for new builds could take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner, but on the positive side you have heard us talk about this, we continue increase demand for some of our aftermarket service capability such as our Parker Tracking System that enables asset integrity management of field and we've had good traction with that.\", 'On agriculture, we expect sales of farm equipment down industry wide and our demand continues to be consistent with that. By focusing on energy, we continue to increase our market position with large frame turbine OEMs and this has been a plus because there continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. so it has allowed us to participate in that. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business, it did get a boos with the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended so that was a positive for us in the quarter.', 'Turning to heavy truck in North America, current forecast, ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast and our North America transportation business is down high single-digits better than industry build rate declines and I would attribute this to some new product introduction. And really our aftermarket exposures there kind of softens some of that down turn.', \"On the mobile markets, I think a real positive Tom mentioned turf, its North American central market but continues to be a real strong highlight for us and then with all the major construction equipment that continues to experience top-line decline. But there does seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And the in plant automotive, really this is a key North American distribution that covers that and we're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there.\", 'Just touching on Europe distribution trends are consistent with really last quarter distribution side, the industrial MRO automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive and then anything tied to oil and gas as I mentioned before continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us really contained in our Win Strategy initiatives is distribution is up in emerging markets Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single-digits, combination of organic growth within the region, but cost effective increased market participation by us.', \"Oil and gas demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment and that really still is a bit of a standstill, but then again this is another area where we've had some really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at a first fit level. And then on Ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now I would call an increase in normal seasonality.\", 'On heavy truck stronger demand continues in the quarter and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2, we saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And mobile demand is stabilized at current activity level. We did have a large exhibitive at the recent [indiscernible] show and I think all of us were encouraged by one of the attendance, but also the favorable settlement taking place at the show. So may it gives us some freedom to do somewhat positive going forward.', \"Turning to Asia now, really distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year, China is the biggest issue, it’s the most sluggish it’s down high single-digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we’re up across the region, I give this a lot of credit to what our guys are doing on expansion and we've talked to you about such as [indiscernible] in some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there.\", \"Energy across the region, we still seeing increased activity and renewable which wind solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal, gas and nuclear store taking the major share and we are participating in those. We always talked about, Tom mentioned that is an accelerating growth, it continues to be great story, we've commented for some time on the strengths of this in market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder, we’ve recently signed high speed rail contracts with Laos, Thailand and Indonesia and we continue to have strong exposure to build rails.\", 'And then on mobile construction, we have seen some modest growth in China and I have heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that for the most part, the OEM inventory is still extremely high, so I think it will take some time for us to see that but our business has stabilized in current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America, I think it’s really dominative by the Brazil story, our construction equipment, Ag markets, etcetera is still very soft.', 'But there is decent activity if you get outside Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really dwarfed by Brazil. So taking all together total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as resulted of I mentioned North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining and the words that keep coming to our minds to describe what we’re seeing on a year-over-year basis.', 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay, thank you. I’ll get back in queue.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open please go ahead.', 'Joseph Ritchie', \"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first question is around the restructuring actions. I know it's hard to comment much at this point on 2017, but it seems like the payback that you got on these actions, the additional realignment actions, is really good. I guess my question is how are you thinking about - when you are thinking about the magnitude of restructuring for next year, how are you thinking about the potential payback and is it going to be mostly headcount-related?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Jo, this is Tom. So, on the restructuring I would just say in general, we’re really pleased with our team, team around the world. The execution has been timely, we've been thoughtful on how we've done it and I'm just very proud of how the team has performed on the restructuring and that’s been a big part of the timeliness and that has been a big part of what's helped our margins perform this year.\", \"As far as next year, we’re going through, I still think my characterization would be somewhere between the $120 million to $120 million to $125 million, is probably a good indicator. I still think that for the most part as restructuring is a pretty good payback from a time period standpoint, usually the 12-month indicator obviously it’s in a more traditional or international orientated type of restructuring, will take longer, probably 18-month to 24-months. But in general it would still be aimed at the more strategic restructuring that we've been talking about which is at the forehead of the company, but we’ll continue to look at as we just traditionally have the footprint optimization as it makes sense.\", 'Joseph Ritchie', \"Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, Tom, your comments earlier about going from an accelerating to a decelerating decline, I'm just curious within that context what's going on with the pricing environment? Are you seeing any pressure across the portfolio today? Have you started to see stabilization there as well, just curious? Any color there would be helpful.\", 'Lee C. Banks', 'Joe this is Lee, I’ll just give you some comments on that. So I would characterize price realization is very tough candidly. We did raise prices to distribution in this past January, its mostly around non-core and late lifecycle type of products, but we did realize price there. But one thing we do track and you’ve heard us talk about this in the past, we have an SPI Index which tracks year-over-year pricing by partner. And we have a PPI which tracks our input costs. And we do have a positive spread here and we look at continuously. So I would say if you had to characterizes overall, it’s pretty much flat.', 'Joseph Ritchie', 'And Lee, is that spread mostly being driven by the denominator? Is it just because the cost environment has remained favorable and could that potentially reverse itself as we progress through the year??', 'Lee C. Banks', 'I would say top-line, the SPI number is flat, as I talked about, but the PPI is giving us the spread, yes.', 'Joseph Ritchie', 'Okay, great. Thanks guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Good morning, Jeff.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Just on the buyback, it looks like it slowed here a little bit and M&A has kind of been weak. I just thought as we come on the deadline for this $2 billion to $3 billion, we would be tracking more towards the high end. Maybe just update us on how you are thinking about buyback?', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Jeff, this is Tom. So in the buyback, we continue to look at that on a dynamic basis, looking at what makes the most sense for our shareholders and obviously, we’ll update you every quarter. But some things to just keep in mind from consideration. When you look at our cash that’s on the balance sheet 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. It’s important to us to maintain A rating, so that’s a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out $2 billion to $3 million initiatives that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then and now we were $11.3 billion.', 'So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continues to do very well at 10.5%. We’re going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can, we look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active, but it’s always hard to predict the output there, it tends to be lumpy.', 'But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit, but we’re disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in spaces that we understand. And we understand the growth rates, so we’ll continue to be that way. But I think you’ll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment of cash as we possibly can weighing all the variables to try to do the best thing we can on the long-term behalf of the shareholders.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', \"Okay. That's helpful. And then it looks like the guide is mostly North America feeling a little bit better and I think you mentioned some of the restructuring. But just go into a little more detail on what is surprising you to the upside in the North America business?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Well, Jeff, I think Lee probably did a pretty good job of taking you all through that, but in North America, when you look at it sequentially, almost everything was positive in North America. Some of that we get just from the calendar helping us, but in particular the part that I like is that when you look at - in case people don’t understand what I’m talking about these market phases, so you have got accelerating growth and decelerating growth and you have got accelerating decline and decelerating decline. And if I was to show you this dot map of our end-markets in these four phases and if you look at it in Q2, you could see a lot of dots in the accelerating decline.', 'And what’s moved and I would say in particular in North America, it’s been distribution, Ag, semicon, mining, general industrial, but I think the thing we are cautious about is that I think we are getting help from comps for the most part and that at this point still too early, I think to say that there is a general market shifts. So we’re going to continue to look at that data, we need a few more months and another quarter or two to help confirm that.', 'But in the healing process of order entry, step one is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline, so that’s the good thing we are very happy about that. And to put up the kind of numbers we are putting up in this kind of climate I think if you look at us historically is remarkable. And I’ve told a lot of people, when we get to flat, you are going to love the numbers, because flat will be the new high and then we’ll continue to grow from there.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Yes, but on the margin front, is that just greater traction on some of the restructuring, or what really drove the guidance or vision on North America margins??', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'I’m sorry, Jeff. I thought you were talking about sales, but, yes, on margins, it was clearly the return on the restructuring and the simplification actions. We’ve seen faster return and just more effective cost savings.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Okay thanks a lot Tom.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Good morning. Can I touch back on the share repurchases? Traditionally you have always talked about having your own internal model, which you use to determine how much shares you think you should buy back or not. With the $50 million buyback, was your model telling you that Parker shares were fairly valued in the quarter?', 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Ann, it's Tom. It's always a good time to buy Parker shares. We just looked at - again it's fair to looking at all the opportunities and opportunities we can't share all opportunities with it. When we look at all the opportunities we thought the amount that we did was the right amount. We will continue to look at every quarter, we wave obviously dividends first, investment for organic growth.\", 'And if you look at the balance between acquisitions and share repurchase i.e. For the reasons I talked about earlier would be an indicator why we are going to be at the low end of that range because the dynamics of the world have changed once we announce that proposal. We are absolutely committed to the low end of that range, I don’t want anybody to misunderstand me, but things have changed as far as we look at to the top end of the range. The balance above that is all depending on what is the best use of cash for our shareholders.', 'Ann Duignan', \"Right. That's very helpful clarification. And then my follow-up is back to some of the comments you made about restructuring the sales force. We get nervous when we hear other companies talking about restructuring the sales force. It doesn't always work out very well. Could you just give us a little bit more detail on what you are doing there and how comfortable you feel about the progress you are making?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Yes Ann, this is Tom again. We are very, very happy with what we are doing there. I can understand your reservations, but this was done with a lot of thought and here they change, so our groups are organized with exception Aerospace organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our division that they can find the people that own those income products and technologies.\", 'So in Europe as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated on alignment at the markets to being more products centric was still not giving at the markets having that they have lesser concentration or more concentration on technologies and markets, so that we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify interface with the global OEMs with our regional OEMs is in Europe as we now have a 10 Europe OEM teams, which is very similar to what we had in North America, which had someone to access.', 'So we had that two, because it didn’t make sense to be calling on OEMs country-by-country that span the entire Europe. So that’s been in place, in probably six-months to nine-months and we are very incurred with the kind of market share actions that we are seeing coming out of that from that team. And then just in Japan that was the other example that comes in my mind when I made that comment.', 'In Japan if you look at us historically, we had a very fragmented sales force, we now have a sales force that is all aligned that is kind of because of the combination of acquisitions that we had in joint ventures years-ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment on the operating side and we are seeing the results that Japan is doing very well for us. So the organization changes to give you comfort are showing in the numbers and in the market concentrations, so we go account-by-account in various regions.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay. Thank you so much. I will leave it there and get back in line. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'David Raso', \"Apologies in advance. I've been hopping between a few calls. But quite simply, looking at the rate of businesses that you have right now and their various growth rates and not thinking of any change, but incorporating seasonality, when would you expect your organic sales to be back to flat?\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Dave it's Tom again. So that is of course the question everybody would like to know and at this point it's difficult for me to predict. And I won't try to predict that I mean at this point our guidance for the fourth quarter is a minus seven organically, so that’s was a improvement from the minus 9.4 we had in Q3. So that’s the first good sign and like I said in these market phase is when we look at all the markets, we went from a concentration in accelerating decline to now more than move decelerating decline.\", \"We would hope to keep moving kind of clockwise around these phases and start to moving to some kind of growth. But I think it's too early to - honestly we haven’t given indicator of that we would tell you when. Few more data points, couple more months and couple more quarters obviously we are going to be in much better position to tell you, but I would say this with the first step in the hilling.\", 'David Raso', \"Okay. That's fine. Just wanted to get your perspective on that. Thank you.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Your line is now open, please ahead.', 'Eli Lustgarten', 'Good morning, everyone. Can we talk a little bit about where inventory levels are both in the distribution sense and the OEM the best you can [indiscernible]. Are we really passed all the inventory organization, or is there still some going on? And with the pricing, you raised prices at distribution, but we keep hearing distribution people are having trouble passing anything on. Are they taking the price increase and absorbing it, or are they able to pass it through?', 'Lee C. Banks', 'Eli it’s Lee. I was expecting this inventory destocking, so I researched this 10 times before this call. So here is the consensus when I checked this not only from our guys and then I just go out and cal our contacts. If you are involved in oil and gas and you had a lot of OEM exposure, you are still sitting on a lot of inventory. If you get away from that inventory is pretty much normalized at this point in time. I think some of the guys may have gotten hit a little bit by some side effects from oil and gas, but that’s fairly normalized.', \"I would say on OEM inventory where I still see this kind of construction equipment, mining markets especially Asia comes to mind. If you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean there is just excavators and wheel loaders that go on for miles so. But our North American distribution, I'm most comfortable that outside of oil and gas, it’s not a big issue.\", 'And then your second question on pricing, I can’t really comment on that. What we did there was really non-core, so I can’t really comment too much on that. I have not had any feedback that it’s been a big issue. If anything, it’s been positive with our [indiscernible].', 'Eli Lustgarten', 'Alright. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', 'Hi. Good morning guys.', 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Good morning, Josh.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', \"Just maybe to ask Raso's question a little differently. On the orders front, you guys can obviously see the comp getting easier there, orders quarterly down a little bit more than maybe the comp was, got easier this quarter. Is there a potential for orders to get back to flat in June, understanding that it may be a while longer before sales quite get there?\", 'Jon P. Marten', 'Josh, Jon here just to be responsive to your question. Of course, we are not calling for that in our guidance going forward. When you take a look at the orders overall for Parker, we are just looking at - we were at this time last year down four and we were down nine, down 11, down 12, now we are down six. So the question is what is the rate of the incline in the reduction of the orders for the company.', 'We don’t have that forecasted or we’re going to be looking at that very closely, it’s going to be fully aligned with the end market progress that Lee and Tom have been making. And we are gaining market share, we are launching the end markets. And as Tom said, I think our best characterization is that it’s a moderately decline and obviously moderating. But we’ll coming out with that answer when we do our guidance in August. But right now in April, it’s a little too early to give you a very detailed answer to that.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', \"Okay. And then just to revisit the buyback discussion. It sounded like maybe there were some mitigating factors in the quarter that stayed your hand, but is there a period of time that passes when some of those other opportunities go away or aren't actionable, or are actionable and you guys are left with buyback, or is this something that is a little bit more structural in nature? Just trying to get the overall strategy there maybe versus like a one-quarter event.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Yes. Well, the overall strategy hasn’t change. We want to be great generators of cash and great deployers of cash. And I think the generators of cash, the Win Strategy continue to work that aggressively with the changes that we’ve made we are 10.5% now. We like being that and we would like to work that even higher. And we are going to do that through continue to grow our operating earnings and continue to working capital down.', 'On the deployment, it’s the same priorities that I’ve mentioned. It’s just trying to make the businesses and I wouldn’t read one thing to aggressively into one quarter on this. The buyback announcement is going to expire and my preferences to tell you every quarter what we are doing as appose to making some big announcements what we are going to do from the period going forward.', 'There are some natural considerations given the amount of cash that’s permanently invested overseas, our desire to keep an A rating and the fact this program was rolled out two-years ago, and a lot has changed two-years, or approximately two-years ago. But we like all those avenues and we want to be as deploying cash as we are great at generating the cash, and I would look for us to do that. And I can’t show you everything that we see, but we’ll continue to do the best we can on behalf of the shareholders for what we think is best long-term.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski', 'Alright. Thanks again.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You mentioned mining as showing decelerating declines. Can you help us on whether that was related to shipments into OEMs or an MRO comment?', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'I think on the mining, what we saw in generals that probably a little bit more help on the, I would say it would be both. OEM in general comparing Q2 to Q3 got a little bit better distribution got a little better as well, but for the most part it’s probably more the comps that are helping us at this point. We’re not ready to declare a victory in any of these areas, get a couple of more quarters and we see this move then I think we already say it’s more than markets, at this point it’s probably the comps helping us more than anything.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Okay thank you Tom and then if you cover this, I missed it I apologize on the incremental $85 million benefit you expect during this year from restructuring in simplification, how much have you realized year to data and if you can give it in the quarter?', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Yes Andy of the $85 million that is we are expecting $40 million of that in our Q4 so $65 million for the second half, $85 million for the year of the second half $42 million in Q4.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Okay and then thank you Jon and that should that step up, kind of continue into the next fiscal year or would you expect with the additional restructuring that you kind alluded to it have even more it’s step up kind of back half loaded next year?', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Yes there is no doubt that the savings that we’re getting from this year we’re carefully carry through for a period of time into next year and it’s too early for me to give you too much color on the numbers that the Tom was referring to early in his comments about the restructuring and the savings that we get for next year. So I don’t want to give you an answer to that would be misleading, I just wanted to kind of tell you that clearly we are not going to taking a step back for saving that we’re getting on, its permanent that is going to be a very helpful tailwind for us for next year.', 'Andrew Casey', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Thank you Andy.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from lines of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. please go ahead.', 'Nathan Jones', 'Good morning, everyone. Can we just clarify on that last point, $40 million restructuring savings in 4Q. So is $160 million annually the new run rate that you are looking at from the $120 million, or should it be a little bit higher than that?', 'Jon P. Marten', 'I do not think it’s going be higher than that. It’s not going to be $40 million for quarter going forward here Nathan. So I want to research that one further here but that’s just the way that we calculate the savings here based on the restructuring that we’ve done year-to-date and that would - be most of the restructuring of course that we’re doing in Q4 the actual restructuring is going to give us savings next year.', 'Nathan Jones', 'Okay. If I could get into North American margins from a different angle here, on a year-over-year basis for the quarter you just reported, organically, you lost about $200 million of revenue. All else equal, I would think the decrementals on that should be somewhere in the vicinity of 25%. So you started about $50 million in the hole on operating income and you are up about $25 million. So from other avenues, you gained about $75 million of operating income. Could you bucket the main places that that came from, where the savings came from, what is improved execution, what is productivity, those kinds of things?', 'Jon P. Marten', \"Well certainly I can’t detail it down to you for dollar, but as Tom and Lee had talked about the productivity that we’re saying from the New Win Strategy is a significant portion of that number Nathan and as we apply the techniques that we've known for years and the ones that we’re really focusing on here with the New Win Strategy, we’re seeing margins in a declining environment that we’ve never seen before.\", \"And so what gratified by that as significant portion is just additional incremental productivity that’s not necessarily you know to take the place of the savings that I’ve been taking about when we do those simplification efforts or the restructuring efforts that we've done in the company.\", 'So I can’t detail it down to you, dollar-by-dollar, but what is happening with the margins and the reason why our decrementals are so impressive is because of the dedication of our employees to rebuild our efforts on productivity in the company and our ability to get savings from the restructuring that we’ve done you know in the past year.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Yes, they were really very impressive. Just one for Lee. Lee, you talked about mobile OEM China inventory. This is an issue we've been dealing with for probably going on five years from the overstimulation coming out of the last recession in China. Any attempt at guessing when that inventory may clear?\", 'Lee C. Banks', 'You know to be clear with you, there does seem to be some positive sentiment with some of the stimulus that the Chinese government is trying to use, but it’s way too early to tell on that.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Okay. That's fair. Thanks very much.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Brian, I see that we are at the top of the hour, so we could just take one more question, please.', 'Operator', 'My pleasure. Our last question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.', 'Joseph Giordano', \"Thanks for sneaking me in here. Quick on the decrementals, kind of like what Nathan hinted at, when I'm comparing North America to international and granted both are - decrementals have been great on both pieces of those businesses - but we are seeing more pronounced organic declines on a year-on-year basis in North America, but margin is actually going up, so can you walk us through what maybe the different types of initiatives going on, on the restructuring side between the two segments as to what might be driving even more pronounced decremental reductions in North America?\", 'Jon P. Marten', 'Yes. Joe sure, just real quick on a top level, although we’re down higher organically and you are absolutely right, in the North America than we are in international, our decremental MROS on an adjusted basis is 13 for North America versus about 19. Now in any environment that 19 in our history, in our company is a very impressive number. But it is distinguished from North America, I believe it has something to do with the level and depth of some of the restructuring that we’re doing a little bit of the quicker payback in restructuring in North America versus internationally. But in both cases, we’re making great progress and we’re kind of - we are seeing a little bit of difference, but this historically in North America and in our industrial businesses.', 'The best we’ve ever done in the downturn like this especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we’re talking of a negative nine, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative seven here coming up. So the short answer is very quick actions, quick recovery, dedication on the part of our management teams both in internationally and in North America and our ability to be resilient and adaptable as a company today versus maybe in some of the prior downturns in the past periods.', 'Joseph Giordano', 'Great. And then just last for me, in terms of scale, maybe you could put this in the appropriate context for us on the simplification efforts and removing of divisions, things like that. How many SKUs have you guys gotten rid of on a percentage basis or something just to give us a sense of how much this has really changed??', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Yes, this is Tom. That will be very difficult to answer. I couldn’t even hazard I could guess. But just recognize that we are working at last couple of percent of revenue. It does carry a disproportionate amount of costs and part numbers and quote activity and that’s the focus. But I couldn’t you give you a guess on that amount.', 'Joseph Giordano', 'Alright good enough. Thanks guys.', 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. This is all the time we have for questions and answers today. Thank you for your participation on today’s call. You may now disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.']","', 'Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Corp. Quarter Three 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will host a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.', 'Now I will hand the floor over to Jon Marten, Chief Financial Officer. Sir you have the floor.', 'Jon P. Marten', \"Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's third quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference.

Following Tom's comments, I will provide a review of the company's third quarter FY 2016 performance together with the revised guidance for FY 2016. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we'll open the call for a Q&A.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slide number four.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', \"Thanks Jon, good morning and welcome everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today we are going to cover four key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results. Second, some commentary on key market trends, give an update on the revised full-year guidance and finally I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives under New Win Strategy.\", 'So beginning with the third quarter results, sales declined 10.6% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5% and organic sales declined approximately by 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.', 'Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.', 'During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014. However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I’m very pleased to be delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis points improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.', 'During the third quarter, we delivered decrementals margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our team. This quarter remarks the 5', 'Year-to-date we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of the sales despite of $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishment by our team. Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker’s ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver less difficult financial performance.', 'So now a few brief comments on key end-markets, so reflecting on the order rates over the past year, we are encouraged with a point of moderating with the decline. More specifically from Q2 to Q3, we saw number of end-markets moved from what we would classify as accelerating decline to decelerating decline, which is a good sign.', 'We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends, we will provide you an update in our August call. As usual we will provide more details on our specific end-market during the Q&A portion of this call.', 'Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we’re increasing our guidance for earnings to the range $6.20, $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which resulted in earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint, increase can be attributed third quarter - and incremental savings we’re now seeing from the realignment actions we’ve taken year-to-date.', 'We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which for the full-year will go from a $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. As we move deeper into the New Win Strategy initiatives our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive front on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.', 'Now let me give you some highlights from the New Win Strategy, we continue to make meaningful progress with our one strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive over all growth and financial performance.', 'Let me take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas. Starting with safety, we’ve a 29% reduction in reportable injuries comparing to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year-ago on our rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety focused high performance teams.', 'Our goal is to reach zero accidents, the significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results. Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. The focus is on four key areas, revenue complexity, organization structure and process, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It’s a strategic revenue of our over head but also strategy review of our organization and process to improve our customers experience with Parker and also to only drive growth.', 'I’ll give you few examples with that. Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and products introduced for future growth. Our sales force organization we designed is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions. An another example, normally at this time of the year, we’re working through an extensive annual planning process.', 'This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. what used to five-months, now takes eight-weeks. In August we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.', 'Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize, I’ll give you a three examples on innovation front. Several years-ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive sensible gels to help cool delicate electronic components and mobile devices and automotive applications, such as closed room avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast growing markets. During the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive the FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology Indego.', 'Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals for spinal cord injury which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we’re positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than three-years an already generate initial sales in FY 2016.', 'Plan for launch next year is a C&G fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for class five to eight trucks. This module is a one-piece design that increases multiple products into a central compact system. We’re optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product. These examples showcases just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that creates vitality and growth from new products and technologies.', 'So in summary, by executing the New Win Strategy we are confident we’ll achieve our key financial objective by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of a 150 basis points higher and the rate of global industrial production. We’re also targeting [17%] (Ph) segment operating margins and progress total towards these goals is expected to drive in compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period.', 'I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker top cortile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.', 'So for now, I’ll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter.', 'Jon P. Marten', 'Thanks Tom and at this time please refer to slide number five, I’ll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $151 versus $2.06 for the same quarter and year-ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and comparison $0.04 for the same quarter last year.', 'On the slide number six, you will find a significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 for the third quarter FY 2015 to a $51 for the third quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.', 'Reductions to adjusted per share income include other expense that total $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year in which last year sizeable one-time favorable currency adjustments were recognized lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end-market and $0.10 from increase effective tax rate driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.', 'Moving to slide number seven, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter. Total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year, there was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact of reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.', 'Total company’s segment operating margins for the third quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end-market softness. Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of a reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end-markets.', 'Moving to slide number eight, I’ll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact in currency of 0.8% in the quarter.', 'Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $236 million driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end-markets.', 'On slide number nine, I’ll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%, currency negative impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end-markets.', 'I’ll now move to slide number 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible, sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year reflecting a combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the New Win Strategy.', 'Moving to slide number 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represented trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter-end, reflecting less negative quarter rates and Industrial segments and Aerospace segment or orders turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a positive 1% for the quarter.', 'Now turning to slide number 12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million, when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $81 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.', 'In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of dividends, $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in the Q3, $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.', 'The revised full-year earnings guidance for FY 2016 is outlined on slide number 13. Guidance is being provided on in adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share excluded expected business realignment charges or approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY 2016. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9 to negative 9.9 or negative 10.9 at the midpoint as compared to last year.', 'Adjusted organic growth as in midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacted sales by three, the majority of which is attributed to the industrial international segment. We have calculated the impact of currency the stock range as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the result in year-over-year impact for the balance of 2016.', 'For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint, this compares to 14.9% for FY 2015 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to those level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end-market declines.', 'The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full-year guidance is $137 million.', 'And for the full-year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY 2016. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.', 'Slide number 14, you will find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases includes $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts, an increased savings from restructuring actions taken to-date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count.', \"The company's decision to increase full-year realignment cost to $120 million results in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.\", 'On slide number 15, you will find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases included $0.18 and segment operating income and $0.08 from reduce corporate G&A, interest and share count.', 'This is partially offset by $0.06 increased in other expense and taxes. Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY 2016. For consistency purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared comments.', \"Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams', 'Thanks Jon. I’m very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members around the world. We are well in the challenges of our end-markets and delivering impressive performance.

Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance, and finally I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy.\", 'Let me start with the fourth quarter and full-year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw a sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis.', 'Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year, and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. By segment, North America is still weak, but our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis.', 'Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis, or a 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported, or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis.', 'Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8%, or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance and represents a 70 basis point improvement year over year in adjusted segment operating margins. Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level of performance I can remember in any previous downturn.', \"Just a few other full-year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during a downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And, notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do.\", \"Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we've repurchased $108 million in Parker's shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. As we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker's shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014, we are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment.\", \"Regarding FY 2017 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectation is that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter two, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in a range of $6.15 to $6.95 per share, or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, for a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share.\", 'So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with the initiatives across our four broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.', \"Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a zero-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost, and delivery.\", \"Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our Likely to Recommend (6:33) initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we are gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative, because a better customer experience will drive faster organic growth for Parker. We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities that will deliver a best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers.\", 'Now, moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution, and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jäger group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group.', 'And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower non-reoccurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had, and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company, as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY 2016 is at 2004 levels, or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members.', 'This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and Lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future.', \"So, in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020. And this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period. I am very pleased at how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.

Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to slide number 6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.\", 'Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13, which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.', \"On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A; interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY 2016 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY 2016; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 2015 from early retirement expenses incurred, and a lower effective tax rate in FY 2016 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of 2015. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per-share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which was driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter to quarter.\", \"On slide number 8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY 2016 versus 29.3% in FY 2015, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY 2016; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding, reflecting the full-year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY 2016 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized in FY 2015 and the full-year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014.\", 'Moving to slide number 9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter.', 'Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year.', 'For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year 2017 (sic) [2016] decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year 2016, adjusted for realignment cost incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year 2015. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY 2016 was $107 million.', \"Slide number 10 discusses the business segments. And I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million, as compared to $15 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million, as compared to $244 million, which was driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment cost was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year.', \"Now, turning to slide number 11, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment – organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or a negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year.', \"And I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 2016 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development cost to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities.', 'Going to slide number 13. Moving to that slide is a detail about order changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction, and agricultural. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter.', \"Looking at slide number 14, we report the cash flow from operations. For the fourth quarter, cash from operating activities was very strong at $488 million or 16.5% of sales. This compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.170 billion or 10.3% of sales, as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for the $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.370 billion or 12.1% of sales as compared to 10.2% in fiscal 2015. There was no pension contribution made during FY 2015. The significant uses of cash during the year included $158 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx, equating to 1.3% of sales for FY 2016.\", 'Now, turning to guidance for FY 2017. The full-year earnings guidance for FY 2017 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY 2017.', \"Total Parker adjusted segment operating are margins forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY 2016 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest, and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full-year guidance, on an adjusted earnings per share, is $6.40 to $7.10, or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY 2017. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range.\", 'Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution split for a year for us. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half. EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half. Q1 FY 2017 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses.', \"On slide number 16, just some influences on EPS for 2017 as compared to 2016. On slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense.\", \"Key components of the decrease include a $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29%, and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expense as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY 2017. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY 2017. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates.\", \"This concludes my prepared remarks. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Thanks, Jon. We are very proud of the fiscal 2016 results. I'd like to thank Parker team members around the world for their efforts. These accomplishments carry even greater significance given the $1.35 billion drop in sales that occurred during the year. While we still have much more to achieve, we are positioned well for fiscal 2017 and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. Together, we are building a stronger and better Parker. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progress.\", \"So at this time, Candace, we're ready to take questions if you want to go ahead and open the lines.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions on the guidance. One of the things that struck me is generally when you guys guide for the fiscal year you come in well below consensus and you're sort of at the midpoint, which struck me. So any comment on that? But specifically, I'm trying to get comfortable with – can you give color on the orders in North America, which I think were down in the 10% range, which I guess surprised me. So I'm trying to bridge that with your sales guidance in North America, which seems more optimistic. And then at the same time, on a down sales year over year, you're expecting margin improvement on an adjusted basis. So if you could address those issues, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay. Jamie, it's Tom. Let me just – the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be year of sales leveling off, which after the sharp reduction that we had last year is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecasted this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half.\", \"So our thoughts behind the numbers. The natural resource related end markets – so construction, ag, mining, and oil and gas – are moderating. Now, they're going to continue to be, year over year when we finish 2017, negative. But they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entry that we had in Q4, in particular what drove our thoughts with international is that we had a positive international, plus 3%, and that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia-Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%.\", \"Now, you talk about North America. Now, what we saw in Q4 I characterized as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, April started off a little bit softer than we would've liked. And then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is if you look at the natural resource related end markets that I described, they really bottomed the North America in our second half of the year.\", \"So we're not really anticipating any new catalysts – any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half, and we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets like machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration, that is going to now help to offset some of that – not completely because we're still end the North America at a minus 3%.\", \"Now, if I could, I'm just going to give you context – our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal 2017, and I want to put an asterisk by this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So I have them in three buckets, positive, neutral, and negative. So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is aerospace, lawn and turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. In the neutral area is automotive, distribution, and life sciences, and power generation. Now, of significance is distribution in neutral now. Well, that's not an end market, it's a big channel for us, and the fact that distribution moves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then under negative is construction, farm and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining, and oil and gas.\", \"So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know, but that's what we think for 2017.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"That's helpful on the top line. Sorry, just to clarify, though, because I'm trying to understand the margin story.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, all right.', 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Like if you could tell me the incremental savings from restructuring actions taken in 2016 that help 2017, and then the $48 million of charges in 2017, how much of that do we realize? The $48 million in cost, how much of that do we realize in savings? And I'm assuming most of that's in North America. And then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. Jamie, Jon here. Just for the restructuring in FY 2017, of the $48 million, we're expecting $30 million in savings in FY 2017. And the restructuring savings that would have been incurred based on FY 2016 actions rolling into FY 2017 is about $25 million. So that is obviously helping our margins going forward, and it's a big driver to our future health, as Tom outlined earlier. So those are the details there. They are about half North America, half international. And one other way to describe them is that they're about one-half simplification efforts and one-half traditional restructuring, which would include some plant closures.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. I appreciate the color.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Hi, Josh.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Yeah. Just maybe to follow up on Jamie's question a little bit. Can you talk about some of the mix dynamics that you're seeing in North America that could maybe support a bit of a margin lift here? Maybe ex restructuring, how should we think about the underlying incrementals and decrementals and the progression through the year, and maybe what you saw in the fourth quarter that gives you the confidence in that launch pad?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"I mean, if I take Q4 sequentially, I was talking about there's really kind of two things that we saw: the natural resource related end markets – Josh, this is Tom, by the way, sorry. We still saw those in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, mining, oil and gas, ag, and the distribution that had exposure to that. But what gives us confidence is when you look at the non-natural resource related end markets in Q4, those saw anywhere from flat to a plus 15%, so distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America. Machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration and air conditioning has been very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt us good about the North America forecast.\", \"The other part is that we do know that the natural resource comps in those particular end markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our first quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything much differently than what we saw in the current quarter. Maybe a hair better because the comps get easier in the second half, is why we forecasted a better comp in the second half.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Is it fair to say that of the – and I'm sorry, Jon, I missed all the numbers that you gave for restructuring, plus carry-over restructuring. Sounded like something around $40 million, $45 million. If I take those and maybe the gap in your guidance is another $30 million or so to get to the midpoint for segment op income, fair to say that that other $30 million is mix? I mean, I guess there's really not a lot of revenue growth. Presumably, price-cost isn't an inordinate benefit this fiscal year. Just trying to bridge that extra little piece to get to the midpoint.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I mean, Josh, altogether I think you've got it. I mean, it's going to be mix. It's going to be further productivity that we're going to realize. It's going to be Lean. It's going to be the normal Parker operating protocols that we use. And we are expecting, without regard to the realignment that we did in FY 2016 and we plan to do in FY 2017, to become even more productive in FY 2017. And so, yes, that's how we bridge that gap internally here.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Okay. So, there's not a scenario, though, where on an underlying volume basis when things are still tough, decrementals kind of ex all the productivity in Lean and restructuring are very low and then you still expect them to accelerate. It sounds like volume is neutral-ish, but there's just a lot of heavy lifting that's going on behind the scenes doing most of that op improvement.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I would say that that's correct. I mean, the volume being flat, as Tom described, in North America, maybe getting a little bit better as the year goes on, and FY 2017 is going to help us from a marginal standpoint in North America and internationally. We are seeing good productivity gains that we've made from the restructurings that we've done in FY 2016 and really, frankly, for FY 2015 also. So we feel like we are very well-positioned from a cost structure standpoint, and we are poised with any tailwinds at all at the high level to really be able to generate some impressive incremental margins, once the volume turns around.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"All right. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll get back in queue.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Morning, everyone.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Nathan.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"So, I think, Jon, you're talking a little bit here about volume in natural resource markets being essentially flat and the comps get easier as the year goes on. I think we kind of entered last year with a similar expectation of some improvement in the back half of the year, which obviously didn't materialize. Could you talk about the differences between what you're seeing in the market now versus 12 months ago that gives you that confidence that you are going to see a potential uptick in the second half?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom. I think the confidence would be, if you just took oil and gas as an example. Nobody could've anticipated going back 12 months ago the rig count reduction that happened, but now the rig counts have stabilized, and the last several weeks, minus maybe a week or two, have actually improved. We're not forecasting them to get any better, but just by the comps, and the fact that they've decelerated or are starting to hold that level, it makes our second half naturally a little bit better. I don't think we're out on a limb with North America at a minus 1% in the second half, given that we normally have a second half a little bit better, and the fact that I think we've seen the worst behind us in the natural resource areas, and those non-natural resource areas that I mentioned starting to show some growth for us. So I think that's why we picked what we did. And at this point, we're as confident as we can be. Of course, every quarter we'll update you as that changes.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Thanks. Is it possible for you to parse out what you think the impact might be on North American orders from the natural resource markets? I mean, you had a nice plus 3% in international and still minus 10% in North America. How much do you think natural resource markets are impacting that in North America versus international?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom again. It's hard to do on an order basis. I'll give you what we saw sequentially on sales. This is what I was mentioning earlier. We saw natural resources in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, including the distribution related to natural resources. And then the non-natural resources were all zero to plus 15%, depending on – refrigeration and air conditioning being the strongest given this time of year. So that's the mix. And the natural resource areas – again, that's about where we've been, give or take a little bit. And as we look to the second half of the year, those comps just get easier for us, and that becomes less of a drag. And the positive end markets start to get us to the minus 1% second half that we forecasted.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"Okay. And just one on how to think about the incremental margins, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you've had historically low decrementals during this down cycle, which is obviously a tribute to the business. Does it also change the profile of the incremental margins that we should be thinking about when volume returns? Is the cost structure structurally changed to the point where you would expect higher incremental margins on volume as volume comes back?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom. I think we would. I mean, historically, when we've come out of a downturn, we would be maybe at plus 40%, and then start to – every quarter that went from the initial uptick, we start to glide down to a plus 30%, and then as you get deeper into a growth segment (42:19) you're in the 20s, potentially probably bottoming out in the upper teens. But I think what we've done structurally, and the fact that we are simpler, leaner, and have a much better cost structure, we would never been able to put up the MROSes that we put up without doing the actions that we've taken.\", \"And just – it's worth repeating again, the all-in reported MROS, 19.5% – so that's all the restructuring – $109 million, which is the highest restructuring we've done in the history of the company. Even with all that, we put up a 19.5% MROS. So, yes, I think it can be higher. Could I peg a number? No, that would be difficult to do, but I would expect it to be higher than we've done historically.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'All right. Thanks very much for the help.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.', 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And nice job on the cost control this quarter.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"My first question is really around just distribution. So, Tom, your comments that distribution's going to be neutral – or your (43:25) expectation is neutral in 2017. Can you give us some thoughts there? I mean, clearly as we ended the quarter, the data points that we got from the industrial markets were pretty weak. We got a slightly more positive data point today from Fastenal. And so maybe just comment on what you're seeing in distribution that will give you the confidence that it actually can be neutral in 2017.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Hey, Joe. This is Tom. I'll start off, and I'd like Lee to just tag-team. I mean, the confidence here is that when we look at how the quarter came out, sequentially distribution was basically flat, and those non-natural resource related areas that we've talked about in the past in the various regions are growing mid-single digits. And we have a really on-purpose program to add distribution, especially in the emerging areas in Asia, in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America. And our teams are working very hard at that. And when we look at the emerging markets, they're showing some positive growth in distribution. So I think that combination of all those gives us confidence that we can come in at a neutral for distribution. I don't know if Lee has anything else to add.\", 'Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director', \"No, Joe, I'd just say commenting on North America, and I've spent quite a bit of time with these guys. There's just no doubt that there's still a big hangover from the natural resource markets, oil and gas being a big one. But have we seen that, (44:54) you do get this impression that things are flattening out. We do see some signs of MRO spend taking place, and it's really a lack of cannibalization of idle rigs that are out there. So we see activity there. And then I think there's just general encouragement through the channel that with the continued strength in the automotive end markets and continued positive PMI data that they are cautiously optimistic that there's some positive signs going forward.\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"So, Lee, is it your sense that from an inventory standpoint, we've now gotten to levels that we need to be in order for your growth rates to reflect end market demand?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director', \"Yeah. I mean, I would say in general that the whole destocking question, I don't see big evidence of that in place. That's not to say there may not be a pocket here or there. But in general I would say inventories are in line with the current activity.\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"Okay. And then maybe one follow-on question for Jon. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your cash bridge for next year? So specifically I'm interested in your pension-funded status, whether there's going to be an additional contribution in 2017, and then any other puts and takes that you could talk about from a cash flow perspective for next year? Thank you.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yes, Joe. I think, first, on the pension contribution, that is possible. I don't want to say that we are doing it or we're not. We're going to have to really look at that very hard, but that is possible. And, if we do it, it would be in the normal range that we've done it over the last several years, other than in FY 2015, which we didn't do anything. And I think that, from a capital standpoint here, from a CapEx, we would be at about 2% of sales. And those are the kind of the big drivers here for us. Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, all together, by $0.11 impacting FY 2017 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted, as well as many other puts and takes that go into making those estimates and doing the accounting for that.\", \"So the CapEx of 2%, we never forecast acquisitions, of course, and from a pension expense standpoint, it's quite possible that we would have a normal contribution there, and that's about what I can give you right now. Is there any more color that you would want at this point?\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'I guess just what the funded status of your pension is today and whether you expect working capital to be positive or negative next year.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah, I think working capital is going to be positive. Now, we're going to show sales growth in Q4, so that will be a slight drag. But we are making tremendous progress on our cost controls, as well as our inventory management. Our inventories are, with this kind of a decline in sales, are at a historic low as a percent of sales. We expect our ability to manage through inventories to more than offset the drag that we might have from the AR as our Q4 shows a little bit better.\", \"Our funded status right now for our pension plans is at 65%, which is a little bit lower than we would want it to be, and that's pure assets to liabilities. Of course, regulatorily, we're well over 100% required, but there would be an argument to make that from a voluntary contribution standpoint that it would make sense given our assets and liability funded status at 65% right now.\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Okay. Thank you, guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore. Your line is now open.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"Hi. A quick clarification first before my question. The savings, the carryover plus the incremental from this year, what's the exact number again?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay. The savings carryover into FY 2017, $25 million. The savings related to the FY 2017 restructuring, $30 million.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'Okay. So basically the segment profit for the year, total company, has guided up about $72 million, $55 from savings and $21 million from pension. Is that essentially the number you have? (49:56)', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah, those are the numbers. I hate to draw a straight line between the restructuring and the savings and our increased guidance, because there's a lot of other factors, as you well know, Dave, that go into that. But, yeah, that would be one way to look at it.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"That's a generic flat revenues, keep profit flat ideally on it, at $20 million plus for pension and $55 million for save, and that's the generic framework.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"My question was the international growth cadence. Can you walk us through – and you said it earlier, I apologize – I know you said it for North America, but I might have missed it internationally. The up 3% for the year, 3.2% to be exact – how do we get there from the down 3% we're exiting the year? Comps get easier, orders are up, but if you can help us with the cadence.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"David, it's Tom. So international, up 3%, 1 point of that is acquisitions; that's the Jäger acquisition for the year. So it's 2 points of growth for international, and our forecast is that that's Europe at flat, Asia plus 4%, and Latin America plus 15%. Now, recognize Latin America is a small number, and it's balancing off a very sharp decline. And what's supporting that is the orders that we saw in Q4 and has continued into July is that of the international orders, we saw Europe around flat. We've seen Asia orders plus 6%, and Latin America orders plus 19%. So we see some opportunities in Asia and Latin America in particular, and we see Europe as neutral. That's what's making up the plus 2% for international.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'And the cadence of that then? Could we be positive by fiscal 2Q? How quickly do we get positive to get the full year to 2%?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'At the end of the first half.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'End of first half. Terrific. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.', 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Hey. Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Morning, Jeff.', 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Hey. So you mentioned capital allocation, you'd be kind of within your range of targets for buyback. And just with six months to go from kind of completing that, can you just update us on as we look past that how you may be thinking about capital allocation, the same or different, or do we get some formal multiyear announcement? Just flesh that out. And maybe while you're at it, touch on acquisition pipeline.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay, Jeff. It's Tom. So let me start with just a clarification. We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, 2014 to 2016. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of – the factors that we've considered of what that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating, and our debt to total cap is at around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were at $13 billion company; now we're $11.4 billion. Now, we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range.\", \"Now, going forward, our desire – let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job, and we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders, and you've heard me say this before, but those maybe have not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities, is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions, and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders.\", \"On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact, because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders.\", \"Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active. But I talked last quarter, and the valuations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. But I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand. So we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. And we'll always continue to buy properties that we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And, again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders.\", 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Okay. Then just as a follow-on on international. Can you speak to what's inflecting in Asia to drive that plus 6%, and then conversely in Europe, any kind of near-term signals of deterioration around Brexit?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Jeff, I'll start on Asia. I'm going to let Jon make some comments on Brexit. But what we saw on Asia, we actually had positive sales in Asia for June and with the positive order entry that we had in Q4 and will continue into July. We saw plusses in life sciences – I'm speaking about Asia in general – passenger rail, power gen, machine tools, and probably of significance, because for the many years we've been talking about this, we've started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular India and Japan, but the good thing is China has finally flattened out, and we've actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing, with the exception of Korea, and Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs, and so that will to start to recover as well. So that's what behind our thoughts on Asia, and I'll let Jon talk about Brexit.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Just a quick comment on the Brexit impact, Jeff. We're in a position where we manufacture and ship out of the UK more than we buy into the UK. And so, since we export more than we import, we don't see that really having an impact on our near-term financials. Now, to the extent that the Brexit impact long term starts to impact the economics there, we'll be watching that very closely, but the UK overall, in terms of our sales there, will not meaningfully drive our top line numbers in any event.\", 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Thanks a lot, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay, Jeff.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open.', 'Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC', \"Hi. Good morning, guys, for two more minutes. Can I just follow up? I think, Tom, you made some initial comments about simplification plans. And I'm curious if there's kind of more to come in that area in terms of things like SKU reduction, or business unit consolidation, or maybe even have some more divestitures. I know you've done a couple of small ones here and there. Can you just talk a little bit about what that's going to look like over the next couple years?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Steve, it's Tom. I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the combination of putting simplification with our Lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at costs and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But, as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these, there's four big areas that we're focused on.\", \"The first is that whole revenue complexity, or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, the tail of revenue, the last couple percent of revenue. We are in very early days on that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward, and that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, but work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us, but very early days on that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of part numbers to go through. That's the more complicated part of it.\", \"We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise; that's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on the number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organization design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people.\", \"On the division consolidations, I think we've taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We had 28 divisions, so basically a quarter of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation, down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because, in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go.\", \"And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more.\", 'Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC', 'Just on potential divestitures going forward?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Oh. Yeah, so we continue to look at the divestitures. That's an ongoing basis. But we like the portfolio as a whole. And you look at our nine motion control technologies, and you look at the seven operating groups. 60% of our customers buy from four or more of those seven groups. So our customers see the power of the systems we can do, the synergies that we can do, across those technologies. That being said, we still look at properties that we think potentially weren't strategic to us or where we weren't the best corporate owner. We'll continue to do that, but I would characterize that as very small, trimming around the edges type of divestitures.\", 'Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC', 'Great. I appreciate it. Thanks.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. And Candace, I see that we're running up against it here. Could we just take one last phone call here, please?\", 'Operator', 'Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Andy.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Got a question on Aerospace, one backward-looking and then a little bit forward-looking. The first – can you give a little more color about the relative performance of commercial versus military, if you want to break it OE versus aftermarket in the quarter? And then also, a little more color behind what drove the 50 basis point margin decline versus last year?', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. On the margin decline, basically, last year, there were a few contractual settlements in the Aerospace numbers. They did not repeat for this year. Of course, those are lumpy, and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now, from breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our bizjet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us.\", \"From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter, and that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders, and again all of these data that I give to you, because it's such a long-term business, it tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial, and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'd be 50%-50% OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now.\", \"So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service for all the commercial aircraft, and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace, and it's been a key to our successful FY 2016, and key to our guidance in FY 2017, too. So I hope that gives you some color there, Andy.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', \"It does, Jon. Thank you. And then I guess two more – I'm sorry to belabor it. But on Aerospace, on the guidance, modest growth, kind of flattish to modest growth, and margins flat to up 40 basis points. Is the margin growth or the potential expansion really mix driven, or are there other factors that are driving that?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, I think it's going to be efficiency. It's going to be the same adherence to all the programs that Tom has outlined before in our Aerospace segment. And it is going to be a natural mix, a positive for us here into FY 2017. Our growth on our new programs is going to be in the low single digits, and our growth in the repairs and aftermarket is going to be in the low single digits for FY 2017. And we also would expect to see our normal growth in our military aftermarket in FY 2017. So there's no one segment of the Aerospace that is driving the growth, and there's no one answer for you on the margins. It's more mix, and it's our ability to just continue to be productive in Aerospace on the margins, and it's across-the-board increases at each one of the major segments there in FY 2017, too.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', \"Okay. Thanks. And I'll follow up on that offline. On the diversified international, if I strip out – take kind of 50/50 split on the savings literally, if I strip that out, it looks like the core incrementals are somewhere around mid-20% range. Is that just application of what you'd expect in year one of some sort of recovery after the downdraft we've seen? Or is there upside opportunity given the Lean operations relative to the past?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I think that it is a reflection of our ability to implement Lean. There is an uptick in of course the incremental returns they're going to get, because as Tom and Lee have kind of described, we're going to see an upturn in sequential revenues as the year goes on, especially in Industrial international. That's our best estimate right now. And so we will see some marginal returns there. That 20% number, it seems, off the top of my head, reasonable, but I don't want to give you the impression that there's not also a lot of favorable disposition in our international Industrial margins because of our ability to continue to penetrate markets, gain market share, and grow in ways that are really quite favorable for the company here and helping us with our guidance in 2017.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. Thank you. And I think this will be the balance of our call here today. I appreciate everybody's questions. I want to thank everybody for joining us. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your calls, should you have any further questions. And I want to thank everybody again and wish everybody a good day.\", 'Operator']","2016","', \"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Q4 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct and question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.

Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, together with the guidance for FY 2017. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slides number 4 and 5.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance, and finally I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy.\", 'Let me start with the fourth quarter and full-year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw a sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis.', 'Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year, and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. By segment, North America is still weak, but our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis.', 'Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis, or a 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported, or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis.', 'Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8%, or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance and represents a 70 basis point improvement year over year in adjusted segment operating margins. Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level of performance I can remember in any previous downturn.', \"Just a few other full-year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during a downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And, notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do.\", \"Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we've repurchased $108 million in Parker's shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. As we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker's shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014, we are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment.\", \"Regarding FY 2017 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectation is that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter two, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in a range of $6.15 to $6.95 per share, or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, for a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share.\", 'So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with the initiatives across our four broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.', \"Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a zero-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost, and delivery.\", \"Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our Likely to Recommend (6:33) initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we are gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative, because a better customer experience will drive faster organic growth for Parker. We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities that will deliver a best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers.\", 'Now, moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution, and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jäger group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group.', 'And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower non-reoccurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had, and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company, as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY 2016 is at 2004 levels, or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members.', 'This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and Lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future.', \"So, in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020. And this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period. I am very pleased at how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. (9:30)\", \"So for now I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year, and 2017 guidance.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to slide number 6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.\", 'Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13, which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.', \"On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A; interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY 2016 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY 2016; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 2015 from early retirement expenses incurred, and a lower effective tax rate in FY 2016 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of 2015. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per-share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which was driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter to quarter.\", \"On slide number 8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY 2016 versus 29.3% in FY 2015, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY 2016; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding, reflecting the full-year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY 2016 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized in FY 2015 and the full-year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014.\", 'Moving to slide number 9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter.', 'Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year.', 'For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year 2017 (sic) [2016] decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year 2016, adjusted for realignment cost incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year 2015. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY 2016 was $107 million.', \"Slide number 10 discusses the business segments. And I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million, as compared to $15 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million, as compared to $244 million, which was driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment cost was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year.', \"Now, turning to slide number 11, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment – organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or a negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year.', \"And I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 2016 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development cost to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities.', 'Going to slide number 13. Moving to that slide is a detail about order changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction, and agricultural. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter.', \"Looking at slide number 14, we report the cash flow from operations. For the fourth quarter, cash from operating activities was very strong at $488 million or 16.5% of sales. This compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.170 billion or 10.3% of sales, as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for the $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.370 billion or 12.1% of sales as compared to 10.2% in fiscal 2015. There was no pension contribution made during FY 2015. The significant uses of cash during the year included $158 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx, equating to 1.3% of sales for FY 2016.\", 'Now, turning to guidance for FY 2017. The full-year earnings guidance for FY 2017 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY 2017.', \"Total Parker adjusted segment operating are margins forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY 2016 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest, and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full-year guidance, on an adjusted earnings per share, is $6.40 to $7.10, or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY 2017. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range.\", 'Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution split for a year for us. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half. EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half. Q1 FY 2017 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses.', \"On slide number 16, just some influences on EPS for 2017 as compared to 2016. On slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense.\", \"Key components of the decrease include a $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29%, and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expense as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY 2017. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY 2017. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates.\", \"This concludes my prepared remarks. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Thanks, Jon. We are very proud of the fiscal 2016 results. I'd like to thank Parker team members around the world for their efforts. These accomplishments carry even greater significance given the $1.35 billion drop in sales that occurred during the year. While we still have much more to achieve, we are positioned well for fiscal 2017 and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. Together, we are building a stronger and better Parker. I look forward to sharing more with you as the year progress.\", \"So at this time, Candace, we're ready to take questions if you want to go ahead and open the lines.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions on the guidance. One of the things that struck me is generally when you guys guide for the fiscal year you come in well below consensus and you're sort of at the midpoint, which struck me. So any comment on that? But specifically, I'm trying to get comfortable with – can you give color on the orders in North America, which I think were down in the 10% range, which I guess surprised me. So I'm trying to bridge that with your sales guidance in North America, which seems more optimistic. And then at the same time, on a down sales year over year, you're expecting margin improvement on an adjusted basis. So if you could address those issues, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay. Jamie, it's Tom. Let me just – the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be year of sales leveling off, which after the sharp reduction that we had last year is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecasted this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half.\", \"So our thoughts behind the numbers. The natural resource related end markets – so construction, ag, mining, and oil and gas – are moderating. Now, they're going to continue to be, year over year when we finish 2017, negative. But they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entry that we had in Q4, in particular what drove our thoughts with international is that we had a positive international, plus 3%, and that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia-Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%.\", \"Now, you talk about North America. Now, what we saw in Q4 I characterized as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, April started off a little bit softer than we would've liked. And then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is if you look at the natural resource related end markets that I described, they really bottomed the North America in our second half of the year.\", \"So we're not really anticipating any new catalysts – any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half, and we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets like machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration, that is going to now help to offset some of that – not completely because we're still end the North America at a minus 3%.\", \"Now, if I could, I'm just going to give you context – our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal 2017, and I want to put an asterisk by this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So I have them in three buckets, positive, neutral, and negative. So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is aerospace, lawn and turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. In the neutral area is automotive, distribution, and life sciences, and power generation. Now, of significance is distribution in neutral now. Well, that's not an end market, it's a big channel for us, and the fact that distribution moves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then under negative is construction, farm and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining, and oil and gas.\", \"So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know, but that's what we think for 2017.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"That's helpful on the top line. Sorry, just to clarify, though, because I'm trying to understand the margin story.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, all right.', 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Like if you could tell me the incremental savings from restructuring actions taken in 2016 that help 2017, and then the $48 million of charges in 2017, how much of that do we realize? The $48 million in cost, how much of that do we realize in savings? And I'm assuming most of that's in North America. And then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. Jamie, Jon here. Just for the restructuring in FY 2017, of the $48 million, we're expecting $30 million in savings in FY 2017. And the restructuring savings that would have been incurred based on FY 2016 actions rolling into FY 2017 is about $25 million. So that is obviously helping our margins going forward, and it's a big driver to our future health, as Tom outlined earlier. So those are the details there. They are about half North America, half international. And one other way to describe them is that they're about one-half simplification efforts and one-half traditional restructuring, which would include some plant closures.\", 'Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. I appreciate the color.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Hi, Josh.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Yeah. Just maybe to follow up on Jamie's question a little bit. Can you talk about some of the mix dynamics that you're seeing in North America that could maybe support a bit of a margin lift here? Maybe ex restructuring, how should we think about the underlying incrementals and decrementals and the progression through the year, and maybe what you saw in the fourth quarter that gives you the confidence in that launch pad?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"I mean, if I take Q4 sequentially, I was talking about there's really kind of two things that we saw: the natural resource related end markets – Josh, this is Tom, by the way, sorry. We still saw those in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, mining, oil and gas, ag, and the distribution that had exposure to that. But what gives us confidence is when you look at the non-natural resource related end markets in Q4, those saw anywhere from flat to a plus 15%, so distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America. Machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration and air conditioning has been very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt us good about the North America forecast.\", \"The other part is that we do know that the natural resource comps in those particular end markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our first quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything much differently than what we saw in the current quarter. Maybe a hair better because the comps get easier in the second half, is why we forecasted a better comp in the second half.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Is it fair to say that of the – and I'm sorry, Jon, I missed all the numbers that you gave for restructuring, plus carry-over restructuring. Sounded like something around $40 million, $45 million. If I take those and maybe the gap in your guidance is another $30 million or so to get to the midpoint for segment op income, fair to say that that other $30 million is mix? I mean, I guess there's really not a lot of revenue growth. Presumably, price-cost isn't an inordinate benefit this fiscal year. Just trying to bridge that extra little piece to get to the midpoint.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I mean, Josh, altogether I think you've got it. I mean, it's going to be mix. It's going to be further productivity that we're going to realize. It's going to be Lean. It's going to be the normal Parker operating protocols that we use. And we are expecting, without regard to the realignment that we did in FY 2016 and we plan to do in FY 2017, to become even more productive in FY 2017. And so, yes, that's how we bridge that gap internally here.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Okay. So, there's not a scenario, though, where on an underlying volume basis when things are still tough, decrementals kind of ex all the productivity in Lean and restructuring are very low and then you still expect them to accelerate. It sounds like volume is neutral-ish, but there's just a lot of heavy lifting that's going on behind the scenes doing most of that op improvement.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I would say that that's correct. I mean, the volume being flat, as Tom described, in North America, maybe getting a little bit better as the year goes on, and FY 2017 is going to help us from a marginal standpoint in North America and internationally. We are seeing good productivity gains that we've made from the restructurings that we've done in FY 2016 and really, frankly, for FY 2015 also. So we feel like we are very well-positioned from a cost structure standpoint, and we are poised with any tailwinds at all at the high level to really be able to generate some impressive incremental margins, once the volume turns around.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"All right. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll get back in queue.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Morning, everyone.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Nathan.', 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"So, I think, Jon, you're talking a little bit here about volume in natural resource markets being essentially flat and the comps get easier as the year goes on. I think we kind of entered last year with a similar expectation of some improvement in the back half of the year, which obviously didn't materialize. Could you talk about the differences between what you're seeing in the market now versus 12 months ago that gives you that confidence that you are going to see a potential uptick in the second half?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom. I think the confidence would be, if you just took oil and gas as an example. Nobody could've anticipated going back 12 months ago the rig count reduction that happened, but now the rig counts have stabilized, and the last several weeks, minus maybe a week or two, have actually improved. We're not forecasting them to get any better, but just by the comps, and the fact that they've decelerated or are starting to hold that level, it makes our second half naturally a little bit better. I don't think we're out on a limb with North America at a minus 1% in the second half, given that we normally have a second half a little bit better, and the fact that I think we've seen the worst behind us in the natural resource areas, and those non-natural resource areas that I mentioned starting to show some growth for us. So I think that's why we picked what we did. And at this point, we're as confident as we can be. Of course, every quarter we'll update you as that changes.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'Thanks. Is it possible for you to parse out what you think the impact might be on North American orders from the natural resource markets? I mean, you had a nice plus 3% in international and still minus 10% in North America. How much do you think natural resource markets are impacting that in North America versus international?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom again. It's hard to do on an order basis. I'll give you what we saw sequentially on sales. This is what I was mentioning earlier. We saw natural resources in that minus 10% to minus 15% range, including the distribution related to natural resources. And then the non-natural resources were all zero to plus 15%, depending on – refrigeration and air conditioning being the strongest given this time of year. So that's the mix. And the natural resource areas – again, that's about where we've been, give or take a little bit. And as we look to the second half of the year, those comps just get easier for us, and that becomes less of a drag. And the positive end markets start to get us to the minus 1% second half that we forecasted.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', \"Okay. And just one on how to think about the incremental margins, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you've had historically low decrementals during this down cycle, which is obviously a tribute to the business. Does it also change the profile of the incremental margins that we should be thinking about when volume returns? Is the cost structure structurally changed to the point where you would expect higher incremental margins on volume as volume comes back?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Nathan, it's Tom. I think we would. I mean, historically, when we've come out of a downturn, we would be maybe at plus 40%, and then start to – every quarter that went from the initial uptick, we start to glide down to a plus 30%, and then as you get deeper into a growth segment (42:19) you're in the 20s, potentially probably bottoming out in the upper teens. But I think what we've done structurally, and the fact that we are simpler, leaner, and have a much better cost structure, we would never been able to put up the MROSes that we put up without doing the actions that we've taken.\", \"And just – it's worth repeating again, the all-in reported MROS, 19.5% – so that's all the restructuring – $109 million, which is the highest restructuring we've done in the history of the company. Even with all that, we put up a 19.5% MROS. So, yes, I think it can be higher. Could I peg a number? No, that would be difficult to do, but I would expect it to be higher than we've done historically.\", 'Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.', 'All right. Thanks very much for the help.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.', 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And nice job on the cost control this quarter.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"My first question is really around just distribution. So, Tom, your comments that distribution's going to be neutral – or your (43:25) expectation is neutral in 2017. Can you give us some thoughts there? I mean, clearly as we ended the quarter, the data points that we got from the industrial markets were pretty weak. We got a slightly more positive data point today from Fastenal. And so maybe just comment on what you're seeing in distribution that will give you the confidence that it actually can be neutral in 2017.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Hey, Joe. This is Tom. I'll start off, and I'd like Lee to just tag-team. I mean, the confidence here is that when we look at how the quarter came out, sequentially distribution was basically flat, and those non-natural resource related areas that we've talked about in the past in the various regions are growing mid-single digits. And we have a really on-purpose program to add distribution, especially in the emerging areas in Asia, in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America. And our teams are working very hard at that. And when we look at the emerging markets, they're showing some positive growth in distribution. So I think that combination of all those gives us confidence that we can come in at a neutral for distribution. I don't know if Lee has anything else to add.\", 'Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director', \"No, Joe, I'd just say commenting on North America, and I've spent quite a bit of time with these guys. There's just no doubt that there's still a big hangover from the natural resource markets, oil and gas being a big one. But have we seen that, (44:54) you do get this impression that things are flattening out. We do see some signs of MRO spend taking place, and it's really a lack of cannibalization of idle rigs that are out there. So we see activity there. And then I think there's just general encouragement through the channel that with the continued strength in the automotive end markets and continued positive PMI data that they are cautiously optimistic that there's some positive signs going forward.\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"So, Lee, is it your sense that from an inventory standpoint, we've now gotten to levels that we need to be in order for your growth rates to reflect end market demand?\", 'Lee C. Banks - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director', \"Yeah. I mean, I would say in general that the whole destocking question, I don't see big evidence of that in place. That's not to say there may not be a pocket here or there. But in general I would say inventories are in line with the current activity.\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"Okay. And then maybe one follow-on question for Jon. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your cash bridge for next year? So specifically I'm interested in your pension-funded status, whether there's going to be an additional contribution in 2017, and then any other puts and takes that you could talk about from a cash flow perspective for next year? Thank you.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yes, Joe. I think, first, on the pension contribution, that is possible. I don't want to say that we are doing it or we're not. We're going to have to really look at that very hard, but that is possible. And, if we do it, it would be in the normal range that we've done it over the last several years, other than in FY 2015, which we didn't do anything. And I think that, from a capital standpoint here, from a CapEx, we would be at about 2% of sales. And those are the kind of the big drivers here for us. Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, all together, by $0.11 impacting FY 2017 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted, as well as many other puts and takes that go into making those estimates and doing the accounting for that.\", \"So the CapEx of 2%, we never forecast acquisitions, of course, and from a pension expense standpoint, it's quite possible that we would have a normal contribution there, and that's about what I can give you right now. Is there any more color that you would want at this point?\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'I guess just what the funded status of your pension is today and whether you expect working capital to be positive or negative next year.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah, I think working capital is going to be positive. Now, we're going to show sales growth in Q4, so that will be a slight drag. But we are making tremendous progress on our cost controls, as well as our inventory management. Our inventories are, with this kind of a decline in sales, are at a historic low as a percent of sales. We expect our ability to manage through inventories to more than offset the drag that we might have from the AR as our Q4 shows a little bit better.\", \"Our funded status right now for our pension plans is at 65%, which is a little bit lower than we would want it to be, and that's pure assets to liabilities. Of course, regulatorily, we're well over 100% required, but there would be an argument to make that from a voluntary contribution standpoint that it would make sense given our assets and liability funded status at 65% right now.\", 'Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Okay. Thank you, guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore. Your line is now open.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"Hi. A quick clarification first before my question. The savings, the carryover plus the incremental from this year, what's the exact number again?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay. The savings carryover into FY 2017, $25 million. The savings related to the FY 2017 restructuring, $30 million.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'Okay. So basically the segment profit for the year, total company, has guided up about $72 million, $55 from savings and $21 million from pension. Is that essentially the number you have? (49:56)', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah, those are the numbers. I hate to draw a straight line between the restructuring and the savings and our increased guidance, because there's a lot of other factors, as you well know, Dave, that go into that. But, yeah, that would be one way to look at it.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"That's a generic flat revenues, keep profit flat ideally on it, at $20 million plus for pension and $55 million for save, and that's the generic framework.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"My question was the international growth cadence. Can you walk us through – and you said it earlier, I apologize – I know you said it for North America, but I might have missed it internationally. The up 3% for the year, 3.2% to be exact – how do we get there from the down 3% we're exiting the year? Comps get easier, orders are up, but if you can help us with the cadence.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"David, it's Tom. So international, up 3%, 1 point of that is acquisitions; that's the Jäger acquisition for the year. So it's 2 points of growth for international, and our forecast is that that's Europe at flat, Asia plus 4%, and Latin America plus 15%. Now, recognize Latin America is a small number, and it's balancing off a very sharp decline. And what's supporting that is the orders that we saw in Q4 and has continued into July is that of the international orders, we saw Europe around flat. We've seen Asia orders plus 6%, and Latin America orders plus 19%. So we see some opportunities in Asia and Latin America in particular, and we see Europe as neutral. That's what's making up the plus 2% for international.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'And the cadence of that then? Could we be positive by fiscal 2Q? How quickly do we get positive to get the full year to 2%?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'At the end of the first half.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'End of first half. Terrific. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.', 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Hey. Good morning, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Morning, Jeff.', 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Hey. So you mentioned capital allocation, you'd be kind of within your range of targets for buyback. And just with six months to go from kind of completing that, can you just update us on as we look past that how you may be thinking about capital allocation, the same or different, or do we get some formal multiyear announcement? Just flesh that out. And maybe while you're at it, touch on acquisition pipeline.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Okay, Jeff. It's Tom. So let me start with just a clarification. We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, 2014 to 2016. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of – the factors that we've considered of what that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating, and our debt to total cap is at around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were at $13 billion company; now we're $11.4 billion. Now, we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range.\", \"Now, going forward, our desire – let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job, and we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders, and you've heard me say this before, but those maybe have not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities, is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions, and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders.\", \"On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact, because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders.\", \"Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active. But I talked last quarter, and the valuations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. But I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand. So we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. And we'll always continue to buy properties that we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And, again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders.\", 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Okay. Then just as a follow-on on international. Can you speak to what's inflecting in Asia to drive that plus 6%, and then conversely in Europe, any kind of near-term signals of deterioration around Brexit?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Jeff, I'll start on Asia. I'm going to let Jon make some comments on Brexit. But what we saw on Asia, we actually had positive sales in Asia for June and with the positive order entry that we had in Q4 and will continue into July. We saw plusses in life sciences – I'm speaking about Asia in general – passenger rail, power gen, machine tools, and probably of significance, because for the many years we've been talking about this, we've started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular India and Japan, but the good thing is China has finally flattened out, and we've actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing, with the exception of Korea, and Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs, and so that will to start to recover as well. So that's what behind our thoughts on Asia, and I'll let Jon talk about Brexit.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Just a quick comment on the Brexit impact, Jeff. We're in a position where we manufacture and ship out of the UK more than we buy into the UK. And so, since we export more than we import, we don't see that really having an impact on our near-term financials. Now, to the extent that the Brexit impact long term starts to impact the economics there, we'll be watching that very closely, but the UK overall, in terms of our sales there, will not meaningfully drive our top line numbers in any event.\", 'Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Thanks a lot, guys.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Okay, Jeff.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open.', 'Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC', \"Hi. Good morning, guys, for two more minutes. Can I just follow up? I think, Tom, you made some initial comments about simplification plans. And I'm curious if there's kind of more to come in that area in terms of things like SKU reduction, or business unit consolidation, or maybe even have some more divestitures. I know you've done a couple of small ones here and there. Can you just talk a little bit about what that's going to look like over the next couple years?\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Steve, it's Tom. I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the combination of putting simplification with our Lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at costs and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But, as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these, there's four big areas that we're focused on.\", \"The first is that whole revenue complexity, or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, the tail of revenue, the last couple percent of revenue. We are in very early days on that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward, and that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, but work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us, but very early days on that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of part numbers to go through. That's the more complicated part of it.\", \"We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise; that's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on the number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organization design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people.\", \"On the division consolidations, I think we've taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We had 28 divisions, so basically a quarter of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation, down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because, in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go.\", \"And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more.\", 'Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC', 'Just on potential divestitures going forward?', 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Oh. Yeah, so we continue to look at the divestitures. That's an ongoing basis. But we like the portfolio as a whole. And you look at our nine motion control technologies, and you look at the seven operating groups. 60% of our customers buy from four or more of those seven groups. So our customers see the power of the systems we can do, the synergies that we can do, across those technologies. That being said, we still look at properties that we think potentially weren't strategic to us or where we weren't the best corporate owner. We'll continue to do that, but I would characterize that as very small, trimming around the edges type of divestitures.\", 'Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC', 'Great. I appreciate it. Thanks.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. And Candace, I see that we're running up against it here. Could we just take one last phone call here, please?\", 'Operator', 'Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Andy.', 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Got a question on Aerospace, one backward-looking and then a little bit forward-looking. The first – can you give a little more color about the relative performance of commercial versus military, if you want to break it OE versus aftermarket in the quarter? And then also, a little more color behind what drove the 50 basis point margin decline versus last year?', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. On the margin decline, basically, last year, there were a few contractual settlements in the Aerospace numbers. They did not repeat for this year. Of course, those are lumpy, and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now, from breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our bizjet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us.\", \"From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter, and that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders, and again all of these data that I give to you, because it's such a long-term business, it tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial, and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'd be 50%-50% OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now.\", \"So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service for all the commercial aircraft, and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace, and it's been a key to our successful FY 2016, and key to our guidance in FY 2017, too. So I hope that gives you some color there, Andy.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', \"It does, Jon. Thank you. And then I guess two more – I'm sorry to belabor it. But on Aerospace, on the guidance, modest growth, kind of flattish to modest growth, and margins flat to up 40 basis points. Is the margin growth or the potential expansion really mix driven, or are there other factors that are driving that?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Well, I think it's going to be efficiency. It's going to be the same adherence to all the programs that Tom has outlined before in our Aerospace segment. And it is going to be a natural mix, a positive for us here into FY 2017. Our growth on our new programs is going to be in the low single digits, and our growth in the repairs and aftermarket is going to be in the low single digits for FY 2017. And we also would expect to see our normal growth in our military aftermarket in FY 2017. So there's no one segment of the Aerospace that is driving the growth, and there's no one answer for you on the margins. It's more mix, and it's our ability to just continue to be productive in Aerospace on the margins, and it's across-the-board increases at each one of the major segments there in FY 2017, too.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', \"Okay. Thanks. And I'll follow up on that offline. On the diversified international, if I strip out – take kind of 50/50 split on the savings literally, if I strip that out, it looks like the core incrementals are somewhere around mid-20% range. Is that just application of what you'd expect in year one of some sort of recovery after the downdraft we've seen? Or is there upside opportunity given the Lean operations relative to the past?\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Yeah. I think that it is a reflection of our ability to implement Lean. There is an uptick in of course the incremental returns they're going to get, because as Tom and Lee have kind of described, we're going to see an upturn in sequential revenues as the year goes on, especially in Industrial international. That's our best estimate right now. And so we will see some marginal returns there. That 20% number, it seems, off the top of my head, reasonable, but I don't want to give you the impression that there's not also a lot of favorable disposition in our international Industrial margins because of our ability to continue to penetrate markets, gain market share, and grow in ways that are really quite favorable for the company here and helping us with our guidance in 2017.\", 'Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. Thank you. And I think this will be the balance of our call here today. I appreciate everybody's questions. I want to thank everybody for joining us. Robin and Ryan will be available throughout the day to take your calls, should you have any further questions. And I want to thank everybody again and wish everybody a good day.\", 'Operator']","', \"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Parker-Hannifin Q4 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct and question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.\", 'I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Marten, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Okay. Thank you, Candace. And, again, good morning, everybody, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's fourth quarter FY 2016 earnings release teleconference.

Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, together with the guidance for FY 2017. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Q&A session.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to slides number 4 and 5.\", 'Thomas L. Williams - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance, and finally I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy.\", 'Let me start with the fourth quarter and full-year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw a sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis.', 'Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year, and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. By segment, North America is still weak, but our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis.', 'Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis, or a 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported, or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis.', 'Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8%, or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance and represents a 70 basis point improvement year over year in adjusted segment operating margins. Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level of performance I can remember in any previous downturn.', \"Just a few other full-year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during a downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And, notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do.\", \"Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we've repurchased $108 million in Parker's shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. As we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker's shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014, we are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment.\", \"Regarding FY 2017 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectation is that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter two, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in a range of $6.15 to $6.95 per share, or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, for a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share.\", 'So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with the initiatives across our four broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.', \"Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a zero-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost, and delivery.\", \"Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our Likely to Recommend (6:33) initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we are gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative, because a better customer experience will drive faster organic growth for Parker. We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities that will deliver a best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers.\", 'Now, moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution, and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jäger group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group.', 'And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower non-reoccurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had, and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company, as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY 2016 is at 2004 levels, or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members.', 'This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and Lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future.', \"So, in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020. And this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this five-year period. I am very pleased at how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. (9:30)\", \"So for now I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year, and 2017 guidance.\", 'Jon P. Marten - Executive Vice President-Finance & Adminstration and Chief Financial Officer', \"Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to slide number 6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.\", 'Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13, which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.', \"On slide number 7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A; interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY 2016 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY 2016; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 2015 from early retirement expenses incurred, and a lower effective tax rate in FY 2016 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of 2015. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per-share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which was driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter to quarter.\", \"On slide number 8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY 2016 versus 29.3% in FY 2015, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY 2016; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding, reflecting the full-year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY 2016 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized in FY 2015 and the full-year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014.\", 'Moving to slide number 9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter.', 'Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year.', 'For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year 2017 (sic) [2016] decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year 2016, adjusted for realignment cost incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year 2015. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY 2016 was $107 million.', \"Slide number 10 discusses the business segments. And I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million, as compared to $15 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million, as compared to $244 million, which was driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment cost was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year.', \"Now, turning to slide number 11, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment – organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or a negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year.', \"And I'll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 2016 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales.\", 'For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development cost to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities.', 'Going to slide number 13. Moving to that slide is a detail about order changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year over year excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction, and agricultural. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter.', \"Looking at slide number 14, we report the cash flow from operations. For the fourth quarter, cash from operating activities was very strong at $488 million or 16.5% of sales. This compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.170 billion or 10.3% of sales, as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for the $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.370 billion or 12.1% of sales as compared to 10.2% in fiscal 2015. There was no pension contribution made during FY 2015. The significant uses of cash during the year included $158 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx, equating to 1.3% of sales for FY 2016.\", 'Now, turning to guidance for FY 2017. The full-year earnings guidance for FY 2017 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY 2017.', \"Total Parker adjusted segment operating are margins forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY 2016 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest, and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full-year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full-year guidance, on an adjusted earnings per share, is $6.40 to $7.10, or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY 2017. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range.\", 'Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution split for a year for us. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half. EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half. Q1 FY 2017 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses.', \"On slide number 16, just some influences on EPS for 2017 as compared to 2016. On slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY 2016 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense.\", \"Key components of the decrease include a $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29%, and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expense as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY 2017. Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY 2017. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates.\", \"This concludes my prepared remarks.

We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance. And finally share progress we are making with the new win strategy.\", 'Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter first I’d like to talk about the safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority and as such we start our meetings at Parker with the discussion on safety. So I thought I’d start our earnings call with safety as well.', 'During the first quarter of 2017 we are able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year over year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. And actually we have a long way to go, to reach our goal of zero accidents. But I’m very pleased with the progress we’re making. Safety is important because, not only does it protect our people but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. ', 'Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were 2.74 billion, a 4% declined compared with the same quarter year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic.', 'Total order rates in the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in order since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering and our aerospace systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforced our previously communicated view that we’re progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets.', 'However we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up. Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to 2010 million on an as reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis. A 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share, compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. ', 'This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 base point improvement, year-over-year in the adjusted segment operating margins. Our decremented margin return on sales or MROS was 3.9% for the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter. That our adjusted decremented have been below 30%.', \"It was another strong quarter for cash flow, cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter we've repurchased $115 million in Parker's stock, this completes the previous announced commitment to buyback a minimum of $2 billion in Parker’s shares of October 2016. Going forward our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deplorer of cash, in a way that generates increased long term returns for our shareholders.\", 'Now regarding FY17 guidance. We continue to forecasting a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017 we are maintaining guidance or as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, or middle point at $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. ', 'So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We will continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across four broad goals, engaging people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.', 'Our ongoing execution with new Win Strategy through its first full year implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of our 150 basis points. Higher then a rate of global industrial products. We’re also targeting 17% segment operating margins and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compounding of growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this 5 year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable, long term value of Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders.', 'I’ll now hand things back Jon to review more details on the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance.', 'Jon Marten', \"Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to Slide 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.\", \"Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year. On Slide 6 we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year, increase to adjusted earnings per share include a reduction of corporate G&A expense which totaled $0.11 per share.\", \"A lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16, lower interest expense and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share re-purchase activity which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share, a reduction of $0.08 per share and income was a result of the lower adjusted segment operating income driven by weakened end market topline demand as projected while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share.\", 'Moving to Slide 7, with the review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost incurred in the quarter was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.', \"Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.\", \"Moving to Slide 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.\", 'Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million, as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million, as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.', \"I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial Segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the industrial international segment decreased by 3.2%, acquisition positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for business, realignment cost was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.\", 'Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled 7 million as compared to 12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 144 million as compared to 141 million which despite the weakened topline reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.', 'I’ll now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace System segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter, neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues, growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year.', 'Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter, compared to 2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 73 million as compared to 76 million reflecting the timing impact of higher development cost during the quarter.', 'Moving to Slide 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The diversified industrial segment report on a three month rolling average while aerospace systems are based on a 12 month rolling average. Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter end reflecting easing year ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets.', 'Diversified industrial North America orders decrease year-over-year to negative four, diversified industrial international orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive three and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.', 'On Slide 12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was 114 million or 4.2% of sales, this compares to 0.7% of sales with the same period last year.

Tom, I’ll turn the call back over to you for our summary comments.', 'Tom Williams', 'Thanks, Jon. I’m glad we’ve started 2017 on such a positive note. I would like to thank the appropriate team members around the world for their efforts. Not only have we made meaningful progress with initiatives designed to improve margins, but we’ve also taken great strides to strengthen and sustain our business and better serve our customers. We’re positioned well for the rest of this year and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. I look forward to sharing more with you as always as the progresses.', 'And at this time, we are ready to take questions. So Andrew if you could help to get started.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Nathan Jones', \"I think I would like to talk a little bit about cash generation and cash usage today, very, very strong cash flow quarter in what I don't think is normally an overly strong cash flow quarter. I think for as long as I have followed Parker your target has been 10% of sales converted into free cash flow. Is the new Win Strategy an execution of that structurally changing that target and should we think about cash generation being some number higher than 10 going forward?\", 'Tom Williams', 'Nathan, this is Tom. 10% has been our historical target, it’s still the target. But what we’ve done as far as determining that target is what’s top quartile against our peer group. And it happened to be when we set that goal years ago 10% was top quartile and as we benchmark it today 10% is still top quartile. Now obviously as we continue to raise margins, which is our goal, we should continue to be even better performing, but the goal is to be top quartile, we happen to be a pretty consistent performer in being top quartile on cash and I think you look forward for us continue to do that.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Okay, fair enough. And then the $2 billion share repurchase is complete. The commitment that Don made a couple of years ago there is complete. The balance sheet is still pretty robust, you've still got plenty of capacity there. How should we think about your approach to M&A versus share repurchase going forward from here?\", 'Tom Williams', 'Hey, Nathan, it’s Tom again. So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long term value creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now as far as acquisitions you know being fairly active, as always acquisitions are lumpy and hard to product as far as the [technical difficulty].', 'And I think what is normally -- what historically in the last couple of years has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap and what we are seeing now and I hope would hope over the next couple of years we’ll continue to see this even more is, I think sellers expectations coming closer to reality and I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer and I think properties will become more actionable.', 'So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to pre-announcing we’ll continue to be active and as I’ve said before on these calls what we’ll do is we’ll communicate after the fact. We think that’s the best value creating for our shareholders. We won’t be buying into our own wind and you’ll see us be active.', 'Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generator of cash and we will continue to be even better at that, but we want to be great deployers of cash and put into work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned Nathan that’s sitting there, just to would remind I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there is certain constrains or factors that you have the weigh when you think about how to deploy that and trying to deployed it in a most tax efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders.', 'So we will look at that, we obviously want to put it to work but there is factors you have to consider on that cash that is sitting overseas.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Okay, thanks very much. I'll pass it on.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Andrew Obin', 'Just a question, we are seeing improvement in energy prices and I was just wondering if you could give us some more color if you guys are seeing any impact on backlog or discussions with your customers?', 'Lee Banks', \"Andrew this is Lee Banks here. I would characterize the oil and gas pretty much as we characterized it last call. So year-over-year it's still down. There is certainly is an increase in rig counts taking place, but I would characterized it as almost basically at the bottom with a lot of choppiness taken place in the market. So there is no real catalyst for a significant change at this point in time.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'And just a follow-up on M&A, I have literally had discussions where people are using negative interest rates for a cost of funding for deals. What is the equation between the prices and cost of capital is working in this environment? Are people getting more reasonable given where macro is and how does it balance the fact that you can borrow at almost nothing?', 'Tom Williams', 'Andrew, its Tom. I think the gap I was refereeing to on valuation has been more of sellers continue to use whatever crop pre 2008 mentality as far as forecasting sales based on, we buy properties that we know and understand, we buy things within our space and we have divisions that are in the same space. So we see what the market and our growth rates are and typically there has been disconnect in that.', \"I see that disconnect getting closer which allows things to be more actionable, now your point as far as how we decide to look at the financing side of things, we’re disciplined, we do a disconnect cash flow, we have a certain discount rate that we look at. We have returned criteria's that we considered. And this is all to the benefit of creating value for our shareholders and how we look at that analysis. I think we are very contemporary, we try to look at that in the current environment, so it will be reflective of what's going on in the real world. So I think we will continue to do that robust review.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'Thank you, very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.', 'Jamie Cook', \"Nice quarter. Two questions. One, Tom or Jon, I'm just trying to one, get a better understanding of the margin guidance in International given the performance that you put up in the first quarter given that you actually had a sales decline and your sales for the year are assuming positive growth. So I would assume you would get more leverage there. So if you could just give a little color there.\", 'And then my second question is just on the order front, I guess I was pleasantly surprised that North American declines are lessening and we saw another positive order number out of international on a tougher comp. So can you give a sense of your comfort level that the OE channel is clear or when North American orders should start to inflict positively? Is that in the second half of the year? And then whether you expect the strength in international to continue or when that starts to inflect even better? Thanks.', 'Jon Marten', 'Yes, Jamie. A quick answer from me, this is Jon on the margin guidance here for international. We did it up 10 basis points, we are showing as we made in commentary, a little bit of a better overview in the Q1 and guidance going forward there. We see great progress as a result of our restructuring actions and our simplification ability here in the company wide internationally also. And so we found it was prudent to just move that up 10 basis points and we are really pleased with how we are performing there.', 'Jamie Cook', 'But, Jon, your margins in the remaining nine months of the year implied margins are lower than the first quarter, but we’ll get sales growth?', 'Jon Marten', 'Well, what we are going to do there is that as we look at the mix as the year goes on Jamie, we have a very slight change in the mix going forward here. So we are trying to make sure that we get the best guidance out there. Please keep in mind that there are some seasonal impacts here for going forward here that we are going to see in our Q2, that’s kind of indicated in our guidance too. And that one have an impact on the international margins in our Q2 and as typical in that beginning up our Q3 also.', 'Jamie Cook', \"I'm sorry. What is the mix issue? Is it just more OE or can you just give color on that?\", 'Jon Marten', 'Well, it would be more of an ability as we look at some of the in rows that we are making and some of our businesses in Asia as well as in Europe making new wins getting more business and we are seeing good increases in our sales there for as -- much better than we had projected and that is really helping us to get more business and -- but that OE versus the aftermarket mix here is having a very, very slight impact.', 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay sorry, then just a question on the order inflections for North American International?', 'Lee Banks', \"Yes Jamie, it's Lee. I am going to answer your question and pivot on that too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterize the micro environment as we gave guidance in FY17. And what we talked about was basically we figured this to be a year where most of our market declines that we saw when we decelerate and eventually make it back or close to the flat.\", 'And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1 as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we’d see some small organic growth in year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. And we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in three buckets positive which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY17, neutral and then -- which would be neutral and then negative.', 'So it really hasn’t been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we’re still bullish on aerospace, we talked about refrigeration, air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas.', 'On a neutral front, we talked about automotive, we talked about power generation in rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about, which it really was a positive in our mind that we saw distribution moving to neutral, and what we see, we’re on track to do that. And I’ll comment on North America too for you when. And then negative year over year, which is consistent, it is decelerating for sure.', 'But whole natural resource and markets construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, and oil and gas. All have -- still have headwinds to them and then heavy duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call.', 'Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it’s down low single digits, it’s really in line with the expectations that saw. It’s definitely reaching all those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering and there are still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year, this time for some of these people. What I was encouraged about, is roughly every 4 years we hold a channel meeting in North America with our filed power channel. ', 'And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent two days just going from top to bottom networking, with everybody there and I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed about prospects moving forward. As you would expect areas like the great lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch were still suffering, but it’s not that accelerating rate of decline there is more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY17, so that was good.', 'If I talked about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas. And I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but do get a sense of there if there is a little bit a light at the end of tunnel and there are some talks about some projects happening going forward.', 'Energy markets is another one that we like, overall the large frame turbines was flat year over year but, I’ve talked about this in the past, that we’ve had some good specifications wins there, our content is up, so we’ve seen some strong numbers from that sector for us.', 'And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year over year declines in off-highway construction, equipment off-highway farming and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and railroad equipment. ', 'I’d say one market that was a little worse then we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say the automotive market is a little worse and really I’m talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of it has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year.', \"I’m going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you’re here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say again it’s a same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, if they have a large negative year over year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I’ll say a little bit of headwinds in some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter, we see that coming back. And then oil and gas still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe.\", 'General Industrial, Middle East has been strong for us. There is a lot of projects going on, result of their economic diversification efforts. So we’ve had some great project wins there and then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe and with off-highway construction equipment and heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe largely for international order standpoint largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter.', 'For Asia-Pacific we were encouraged by another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong, we’ve got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new win strategy and we like what’s happening there. And we’ve really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia.', 'Industrially we are up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery product power generation semiconductor, telecom all grew positive in Asia-Pacific. And then in mobile, I’ve highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us. Through some specification wins. We are doing very well there. And really increases in most segments in mobile off-highway construction again very low levels obviously, heavy duty truck farm and ag.', 'And then Latin America, another international component, again another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we’re encouraged by what’s happening there it’s been the first positive movement sometime. So when we think about countries like Brazil, coming back that’s a positive for us.', 'So international order entry accelerated stayed relatively in line, but if we thought in Europe accelerated in Asia, accelerated Latin America.', 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. I will get back in queue.', 'Lee Banks', 'Thanks, Jamie.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Can we just take a step back for a moment. I missed what you said about Turkey. Did you say Turkey was improving or Turkey was a bit of a headwind? You were talking about political activity.', 'Lee Banks', 'I was a little bit of disruptive there when all the political unrest was taking place, but it appears to us to be getting back in line and it was really some distribution business that went soft on us for a period of time.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay, that is helpful. And then Lat-Am orders accelerating. Can you just talk about where exactly you are seeing the demand? Is it distribution? Is it truck? Just a little bit of color in terms of specifically by market or by region?', 'Tom Williams', 'Yeah, I mean these are all very low level. So I don’t want to mischaracterize what’s happening there, but truck has been positive, construction equipment and really farm and ag has been the positive.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on your guidance. The dollar has strengthened against the euro by 4% since the end of the quarter. And I know you said you expect your outlook based on September 30 exchange rates. If you were to do your exchange rates as of today, would you have changed your revenue guidance?', 'Jon Marten', 'Ann this is Jon. I think yes I mean given that track and we have a pattern of a going through and using September 30. We will see how that kind of plays itself out for the balance of the year, but with the strengthening the dollar today I think that it would have an impact on the guidance very slightly.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay, I appreciate it. I will get back in line. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"First, I guess my first question, there has been a lot of concern especially as we have been exiting September that things in Industrial have started to get a little bit worse. And so I'm just curious whether you can provide any color on how things trended in the quarter and specifically that back half of September which has been a hot topic of conversation with folks?\", 'Tom Williams', 'Joe its Tom. So through the quarter what we saw was that North America orders get less negative, which is a good thing and seeing it progress sequentially that way to the quarter. Internationally and aerospace we are relatively consistent through the quarter. In October we haven’t seen I think that’s unusual and October is consistent with what we’ve put in the guidance.', 'Joe Ritchie', 'Okay. Helpful, Tom. And then maybe just given that the earnings number came in a little bit better than expected, Tom, you kind of kept the guidance range wide for the year. I think historically you guys have kind of narrowed in the first quarter. Just curious what your thoughts were around that especially just given the fact that order trends have gotten a little bit better?', 'Tom Williams', \"Yes, two things. One and maybe I will talk about the width of guidance, maybe people didn't pick up. We start -- we did this year in August different than what we have done historically. If you go back and look at our August guidance typically had a much wider range, so we started off the year with a more narrower than traditional range in August and we just kept that the same for the third quarter.\", 'So that part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level and the good thing about what happened in the quarters is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margins so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on that. We got some help below the line with some discrete one off things that are not going to repeat.', \"So we felt that with the mix holding it flat made sense and holding it flat especially in today's environment with the macro environment being I would still say fairly uncertain, but we are encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive. I would like to see a little bit more data before we get too far ahead of ourselves.\", 'Joe Ritchie', 'Got it. That makes sense. Maybe one last follow-up and this is specifically on the below the line items in the guide. I know you guys made a voluntary pension contribution. I assume that was going to be a little bit of a tailwind to your earnings number for this year, but it looks like your corporate number has gone up. And so what is the natural offset there?', 'Jon Marten', 'Yes I think the -- first of all it’s not a big tailwind, but it is a slight few cent tailwind there with that additional contribution that we made. Going on below the line, what would be going the other way as Tom has talked about and many of our different venues over the last several quarters. Our investments in R&D, our investments in ecommerce, our investments in IOT, and the kinds of things that we needed to in order to improve on our well customer experience is really driving the additional expenses here that are helping to offset that $0.05 or so impact that were getting from the additional pension contribution that we made. So I hope that helps you Jon.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"It's helpful Jon. Thanks guys.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.', 'Andy Casey', 'On the quarter could you give a little bit more color on the benefit to operating profit from restructuring and simplification?', 'Tom Williams', \"Andy, this is Tom. Maybe I will start strategically and I will let Jon add with the details in the quarter. But with simplification, the strategy here is really there is four elements of it and we’ve have a focus I would say initially, if you would envision simplification as kind of being an iceberg, the tip of iceberg was division consolidations that was kind of the natural thing out of the gate that we have did. But the bigger part of simplification was underneath that, it's going to product line complex, revenue complexity, organization design work, process changes that we’ll do related to that revenue complexity and there is good old-fashioned bureaucracy.\", 'So we are very encouraged because if you remember simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days and that’s a part of why you have seen from an operating margin standpoint why we perform so efficiently in the last several quarters, and why our decrementals have held up so well. But specifically within the quarter Jon has something more to add on that.', 'Jon Marten', 'Well the only thing that I would say on specifically in the quarter here is, we had $0.06 in restructuring that we actually book. We are going to see about -- we are maintaining our right guidance for the year and we are maintaining our saving that we have projected when we put our guidance together which is about 20% of the savings that we are going to get in the first half for the year.', \"So it kind of came right in along with our expectations, our actual restructuring that we booked in the quarter was a little bit lighter, few cents lighter than what we have projected in the guidance, it's actually $0.03 lighter than what we have projected in that guidance. But we are very pleased with our progress and we are maintaining that projection through the balance of the year.\", 'Andy Casey', 'Okay, thanks, Jon and Tom. If I step back a little bit from the quarter and look at the 2020 goals, you have mentioned confidence in achieving those. If I just isolate the 17% operating margin goal, can you comment on whether you can get there if the market stabilization happens but the markets kind of stay flat after that? Or do you need some end market growth in addition to the 150 basis point outgrowth that you are targeting?', 'Tom Williams', \"It's Tom again. So what we project including the 150 bips greater than the market is a 1.5% CAGR. Now remember the CAGR starts in ’15, so it went down from ’15 to ‘16 which is why that doesn’t sound like a really big number. So we go down because ’15 all the natural resource that dollar but then ’15 to ’16 flatting from ’16 to ’17 and starting grow by -- this time we get to FY20. Our expectation is to grow 150 basis point faster in the market based on FY20 as an exit rate.\", \"When you do the CAGR through that period of time it's 1.5%. So as a background, as long as the CAGR from ’15 to ’20 is a 100% CAGR we think we can get there 17% operating margin. Obviously if it’s lower than that, that’s does going to put challenges on it.\", 'But I think that’s a reasonable expectation given the macro environment, and our goal to gain share and all the other strategies we got around, the Win Strategy to grow fast in a market. So I think that’s fairly reasonable and we feel very comfortable that we can pull that off.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.', 'Joe Giordano', 'We have kind of touched on this but with the orders in North American Industrial getting slightly better on a comp basis, but the revenue was touched a little bit lower like 40 bps, did the order patterns even though it improved come in a little bit lighter than you might have thought?', 'Tom Williams', 'Joe, this is Tom so the sale gap that we have, which is very slight impacted, our guide around $40 million was pretty much equally dispersed between the three reporting segments, aerospace North America and international. So for Aerospace, it was little bit of biz jets softness helicopters, for North America a little softer, and heavy duty truck, automotive and little bit in the general industrial. Then international is mainly a little bit lighter in the Europe, then we had thought. But when you put it all together and based on their order trends that we’ve see and in fact that order trends are moving in the path we had thought they were going to go, we are encouraged, which is why we left the sales guidance flat for the full year.', 'Joe Giordano', \"I guess I was just referring to just on the sales guidance for North America, was touched down a little bit from prior. And orders seem to be getting a little bit better so I didn't know if that specifically -- if the cadence there was a little bit different than you might have thought? \", 'Tom Williams', 'Now these are only slight differences, Joe. We are only down a total of -- for the time period of 19 million for the year going forward were not down, all that much. And so this is us going through each one of our end markets, each one of our business pulling them all together and then coming up with some guidance that makes sense. But I would not read anything into that. Our orders are trending, just the way that we thought that they would. And so therefore we are making just very slight change in the sales as we’re projecting here in the guidance.', 'Joe Giordano', 'Fair enough. If I could just switch quickly to Aerospace for a bit, you mentioned the margins suffered a little bit from development costs. Can you maybe go into a little detail there? And then just two quarters in a row there 14% order growth and how much would you attribute that to comps getting progressively easier or are you seeing some real strength there?', 'Tom Williams', 'Well first on the development cost, I think from time to time, it’s very hard to project these quarter by quarter here and so these are more timing issues than they are anything else. Now on the 14% for two quarters in a row. I want to again -- as you know and everybody on the call knows, we are reporting these numbers because it’s long cycle business at a rolling 12 months average.', 'Now the long term growth rate that we can expect is what we’ve seen almost in the Q1 from aerospace there sales up 3.1%, and our long term growth rate with them is going forward is going to be in the 4% range. And that is something that overall a next 3 or 4 or 5 year timeframe, we feel very confident in saying. So I want to just caution you that to not expect a 14% increase going forward. This has to do with the lumpiness of the orders and how they come in from our military and commercial customers. And the long term prospects are fantastic, but they are not at translating to sales at a 14% per year annum rate.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Stephen Volkmann', \"Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think, Lee, when you sort of went around the horn on all the end markets, I didn't hear you mention anything regarding distributor inventory levels and maybe stocking is kind of waning or something, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. Anything to comment on there?\", 'Lee Banks', 'Steve, I don’t think it’s a big issue, I mean I’m sure there are some pockets out there, that aren’t apparent to me. But by and large that’s not something when I talk to the channel people that we’re worried about. I think a lot of that has worked its way out.', 'Stephen Volkmann', 'Okay, great. Maybe for Jon, it feels like we are sort of tweaking down the guidance I guess for fiscal second-quarter a little bit. Correct me if you disagree, but is there anything to call out for modeling purposes, any kind of below the line item stuff that maybe bounces back or how do we think about that?', 'Jon Marten', 'No, you’re right. I mean I think if there are some onetime events that Tom was talking about that happened in Q1, that was kind of good news for us, that are not going to repeat in Q2. You’re right, your observation is correct, it’s been tweak down just slightly. And there are no other new in different types of activities that are occurring here that would want to call out in a call like this. I think it’s a normal cost structure. Our cost structure is getting better, our volume is following a long our orders. Our orders are coming in the way that we had projected and so we are just a slight adjustments here for the slight bits of a good news here that we got in Q1, especially below the line.', 'Stephen Volkmann', 'Great. That is all I have got. Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Just back on simplification and the division consolidation, I mean you guys have done a great job early on. But Tom, you mentioned a lot of runway ahead. Can you maybe just speak to what are the really big opportunities as you go forward? And maybe along those lines just, Lee, you touched on international distribution maybe just expand on what you are doing there?', 'Tom Williams', 'So Jeff, its Tom. I’ll start with the simplification and Lee can talk about international distribution. For us I think the biggest pull in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue of complexity and when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple of percent of revenue it has a significant, and I would underlying significant amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that’s tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue.', 'Now, we don’t want to walk away from that, we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that’s a big element and because of the size of the company and then just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it’s going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we just now started scratching the surface of that.', 'Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through their product line complexity and simplify it, its old 80:20 type of concept. We are going to change organization design and processes associated and there will be speed, efficiencies, cost, et cetera. And in general an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us, that’s the other big part of the simplification is, is to make it easier to business with Parker.', 'We’ll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things then we will look at good old fashioned bureaucracy which Lee and I talked about it in the past, if you were to do our -- what used to be called internally in the Company, the Black Book of process which is our annual planning process. It was a process that would take 5 months, 20 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process and we drove that down to eight weeks, eight schedules and significantly freed up time for people.', \"So those are just an examples and color on that. We’re early days in this, but I think I would say it's got great momentum in the Company. So I’ll let Lee take over on what we’re doing on distribution internationally?\", 'Lee Banks', 'We have talked I mean many times that our distribution network is our greatest off-balance sheet asset that the company has and we have talked about North America being the gold standard in terms of how we compete and how we get to market. And when we’re putting the new Win Strategy together, although we had done a lot, we were cognizant that we still had not built this network out at the rate that we wanted to throughout the rest of the world. So as we rolled up the new Win Strategy we put a team of senior executives that know how to get this done, focusing on emerging regions in Europe and focusing on Asia Pacific. And we are really encouraged by the progress we are making 12 moths to 15 months into it right now. So very positive.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Okay, thanks guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', \"Just a couple of questions of clarification first. I just wanted to make sure I had straight what Jon said about restructuring. You made a comment about 20%. I don't know Jon if you were saying 20% of a restructuring benefits are in the first half. If you could clarify that and then just a couple of follow-ups.\", 'Jon Marten', 'No you got that right, 20% of the savings that we get from the restructuring that we’re incurring for this year we will get in the first half, so yes.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', 'And then on Aerospace, obviously with these wins and orders you do have this development cost bubble. I’m wonder if you could just give us some sense of how elevated your R&D or E&D is today versus where you expect to see it say in that 2020 horizon?', 'Jon Marten', \"We are at the round numbers at about the 8% level today. We have as you know moved it down from 11% a few years ago. So the 7% to 8% range is the range that historically is a number that we are the most comfortable with. But overall our level of development cost are aligned with what our expectations are of our customers. If there is new and different types of requirements where we are the technical experts then we will be in many cases the designer of choice and that so will fluctuate, but for right now given today's environment 7% to 8% seems to be a right level for us and we are at about 8 right now.\", 'So if in could just have one more question and we will wrap it up for today. I hope that answers your question, Jeff.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Your line is open.', 'Alex Blanton', 'Just a question on the CapEx. The first quarter you had $32.5 million which is about 1.2% sales. That is about half of what you normally do which in turn is half as a percent of sales of what it was 10 years ago. What do you expect CapEx to be for the year? What percentage of sales?', 'Jon Marten', 'It will be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 for the year. So 1.6 to 2.0 CapEx as a percent of sales.', 'Alex Blanton', 'Okay, so that is going to be a pretty low figure compared with what you were 10 years ago.', 'Jon Marten', 'We are not nowhere near as required capital that we did 10 years ago Alex, and that 1.6 to 2.0 includes a lot of reinvestments into the company, but no you are right we are nowhere near where we five years ago, let alone 10.', 'Alex Blanton', 'And that is mainly due to the lean efforts, correct?', 'Jon Marten', \"Yes, it's hard to articulate on the phone call like this, how much lean has transformed our company. And when you add on to that all these affords that we are going through from a business simplification standpoint and how that’s impacting our CapEx plans, we are just seeing a lot of great momentum from that. And so yes, that’s correct.\", 'Alex Blanton', 'So is it just a matter of raising your margins, [indiscernible] profits, the higher profits [indiscernible], when it comes to allocating it to CapEx and [indiscernible] acquisitions?', 'Jon Marten', 'Yes, we are from a CapEx standpoint we feel very good about our positioning there and of course we are discipline, we are using in a IRR approach on that just as we do on the DCS from an acquisition standpoint.

So I hope that helps you out, Alex.', 'Alex Blanton', \"I just have one suggestion on the slide that you list your cash flow -- I guess it is slide number -- cash flow from operating activities, Slide 12. I would give a simplified cash flow statement actually there. You are not presenting the individual components, the major components of cash flow and I realize that is in the cash flow statement in the operating statements, but it would be very helpful to have it right here on this slide so people could see it and wouldn't have to refer back to the cash flow statement.

Mr. Marten you may begin.\", 'Jon Marten', \"Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's first quarter FY '17 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks. Today's presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company's Investor Information Web site at phstock.com for one year following today's call.\", \"On Slide 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements, as well as our non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any references to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are posted on Parker's Web site at phstock.com.\", \"Turning to Slide 3, toady's agenda is outlined. To begin our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams will provide highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's first quarter, FY '17 performance together with the guidance for FY '17. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and then we'll open the call for a Question & Answer session.\", \"At this time, I'll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to Slide 4.\", 'Tom Williams', \"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance. And finally share progress we are making with the new win strategy.\", 'Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter first I’d like to talk about the safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority and as such we start our meetings at Parker with the discussion on safety. So I thought I’d start our earnings call with safety as well.', 'During the first quarter of 2017 we are able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year over year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. And actually we have a long way to go, to reach our goal of zero accidents. But I’m very pleased with the progress we’re making. Safety is important because, not only does it protect our people but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. ', 'Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were 2.74 billion, a 4% declined compared with the same quarter year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic.', 'Total order rates in the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in order since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering and our aerospace systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforced our previously communicated view that we’re progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets.', 'However we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up. Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to 2010 million on an as reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis. A 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share, compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. ', 'This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 base point improvement, year-over-year in the adjusted segment operating margins. Our decremented margin return on sales or MROS was 3.9% for the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter. That our adjusted decremented have been below 30%.', \"It was another strong quarter for cash flow, cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter we've repurchased $115 million in Parker's stock, this completes the previous announced commitment to buyback a minimum of $2 billion in Parker’s shares of October 2016. Going forward our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deplorer of cash, in a way that generates increased long term returns for our shareholders.\", 'Now regarding FY17 guidance. We continue to forecasting a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017 we are maintaining guidance or as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, or middle point at $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. ', 'So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We will continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across four broad goals, engaging people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.', 'Our ongoing execution with new Win Strategy through its first full year implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of our 150 basis points. Higher then a rate of global industrial products. We’re also targeting 17% segment operating margins and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compounding of growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this 5 year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable, long term value of Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders.', 'I’ll now hand things back Jon to review more details on the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance.', 'Jon Marten', \"Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to Slide 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.\", \"Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year. On Slide 6 we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year, increase to adjusted earnings per share include a reduction of corporate G&A expense which totaled $0.11 per share.\", \"A lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16, lower interest expense and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share re-purchase activity which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share, a reduction of $0.08 per share and income was a result of the lower adjusted segment operating income driven by weakened end market topline demand as projected while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share.\", 'Moving to Slide 7, with the review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost incurred in the quarter was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.', \"Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.\", \"Moving to Slide 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.\", 'Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million, as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million, as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.', \"I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial Segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the industrial international segment decreased by 3.2%, acquisition positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for business, realignment cost was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.\", 'Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled 7 million as compared to 12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 144 million as compared to 141 million which despite the weakened topline reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.', 'I’ll now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace System segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter, neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues, growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year.', 'Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter, compared to 2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 73 million as compared to 76 million reflecting the timing impact of higher development cost during the quarter.', 'Moving to Slide 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The diversified industrial segment report on a three month rolling average while aerospace systems are based on a 12 month rolling average. Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter end reflecting easing year ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets.', 'Diversified industrial North America orders decrease year-over-year to negative four, diversified industrial international orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive three and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.', 'On Slide 12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was 114 million or 4.2% of sales, this compares to 0.7% of sales with the same period last year. When adjusted with $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter cash for operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution in May last year.', \"The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $150 million for the Company's repurchase of common shares, and 85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. 33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter is also called out.\", \"Turning to Slide 13, the full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance has been provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of 48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting. \", 'Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat and acquisitions and the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 8.4% currency and guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance FY17.', 'For Total Parker as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2 -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY16 margins, 13.9% on an as reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY16.', 'The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate G&A interest in other expense is 478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%, the average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. ', 'For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY17.', 'The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be 30 million and are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for proposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.', 'Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half. EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 and the midpoint, that’s first half versus second half. And Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be a $1.36 per share at the midpoint and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.', \"On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY17 EPS of $6.75 per share, increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate.\", 'The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense, please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY17.', 'This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I’ll turn the call back over to you for our summary comments.', 'Tom Williams', 'Thanks, Jon. I’m glad we’ve started 2017 on such a positive note. I would like to thank the appropriate team members around the world for their efforts. Not only have we made meaningful progress with initiatives designed to improve margins, but we’ve also taken great strides to strengthen and sustain our business and better serve our customers. We’re positioned well for the rest of this year and beyond under the framework provided by the Win Strategy. I look forward to sharing more with you as always as the progresses.', 'And at this time, we are ready to take questions. So Andrew if you could help to get started.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Nathan Jones', \"I think I would like to talk a little bit about cash generation and cash usage today, very, very strong cash flow quarter in what I don't think is normally an overly strong cash flow quarter. I think for as long as I have followed Parker your target has been 10% of sales converted into free cash flow. Is the new Win Strategy an execution of that structurally changing that target and should we think about cash generation being some number higher than 10 going forward?\", 'Tom Williams', 'Nathan, this is Tom. 10% has been our historical target, it’s still the target. But what we’ve done as far as determining that target is what’s top quartile against our peer group. And it happened to be when we set that goal years ago 10% was top quartile and as we benchmark it today 10% is still top quartile. Now obviously as we continue to raise margins, which is our goal, we should continue to be even better performing, but the goal is to be top quartile, we happen to be a pretty consistent performer in being top quartile on cash and I think you look forward for us continue to do that.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Okay, fair enough. And then the $2 billion share repurchase is complete. The commitment that Don made a couple of years ago there is complete. The balance sheet is still pretty robust, you've still got plenty of capacity there. How should we think about your approach to M&A versus share repurchase going forward from here?\", 'Tom Williams', 'Hey, Nathan, it’s Tom again. So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long term value creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now as far as acquisitions you know being fairly active, as always acquisitions are lumpy and hard to product as far as the [technical difficulty].', 'And I think what is normally -- what historically in the last couple of years has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap and what we are seeing now and I hope would hope over the next couple of years we’ll continue to see this even more is, I think sellers expectations coming closer to reality and I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer and I think properties will become more actionable.', 'So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to pre-announcing we’ll continue to be active and as I’ve said before on these calls what we’ll do is we’ll communicate after the fact. We think that’s the best value creating for our shareholders. We won’t be buying into our own wind and you’ll see us be active.', 'Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generator of cash and we will continue to be even better at that, but we want to be great deployers of cash and put into work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned Nathan that’s sitting there, just to would remind I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there is certain constrains or factors that you have the weigh when you think about how to deploy that and trying to deployed it in a most tax efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders.', 'So we will look at that, we obviously want to put it to work but there is factors you have to consider on that cash that is sitting overseas.', 'Nathan Jones', \"Okay, thanks very much. I'll pass it on.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Andrew Obin', 'Just a question, we are seeing improvement in energy prices and I was just wondering if you could give us some more color if you guys are seeing any impact on backlog or discussions with your customers?', 'Lee Banks', \"Andrew this is Lee Banks here. I would characterize the oil and gas pretty much as we characterized it last call. So year-over-year it's still down. There is certainly is an increase in rig counts taking place, but I would characterized it as almost basically at the bottom with a lot of choppiness taken place in the market. So there is no real catalyst for a significant change at this point in time.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'And just a follow-up on M&A, I have literally had discussions where people are using negative interest rates for a cost of funding for deals. What is the equation between the prices and cost of capital is working in this environment? Are people getting more reasonable given where macro is and how does it balance the fact that you can borrow at almost nothing?', 'Tom Williams', 'Andrew, its Tom. I think the gap I was refereeing to on valuation has been more of sellers continue to use whatever crop pre 2008 mentality as far as forecasting sales based on, we buy properties that we know and understand, we buy things within our space and we have divisions that are in the same space. So we see what the market and our growth rates are and typically there has been disconnect in that.', \"I see that disconnect getting closer which allows things to be more actionable, now your point as far as how we decide to look at the financing side of things, we’re disciplined, we do a disconnect cash flow, we have a certain discount rate that we look at. We have returned criteria's that we considered. And this is all to the benefit of creating value for our shareholders and how we look at that analysis. I think we are very contemporary, we try to look at that in the current environment, so it will be reflective of what's going on in the real world. So I think we will continue to do that robust review.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'Thank you, very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.', 'Jamie Cook', \"Nice quarter. Two questions. One, Tom or Jon, I'm just trying to one, get a better understanding of the margin guidance in International given the performance that you put up in the first quarter given that you actually had a sales decline and your sales for the year are assuming positive growth. So I would assume you would get more leverage there. So if you could just give a little color there.\", 'And then my second question is just on the order front, I guess I was pleasantly surprised that North American declines are lessening and we saw another positive order number out of international on a tougher comp. So can you give a sense of your comfort level that the OE channel is clear or when North American orders should start to inflict positively? Is that in the second half of the year? And then whether you expect the strength in international to continue or when that starts to inflect even better? Thanks.', 'Jon Marten', 'Yes, Jamie. A quick answer from me, this is Jon on the margin guidance here for international. We did it up 10 basis points, we are showing as we made in commentary, a little bit of a better overview in the Q1 and guidance going forward there. We see great progress as a result of our restructuring actions and our simplification ability here in the company wide internationally also. And so we found it was prudent to just move that up 10 basis points and we are really pleased with how we are performing there.', 'Jamie Cook', 'But, Jon, your margins in the remaining nine months of the year implied margins are lower than the first quarter, but we’ll get sales growth?', 'Jon Marten', 'Well, what we are going to do there is that as we look at the mix as the year goes on Jamie, we have a very slight change in the mix going forward here. So we are trying to make sure that we get the best guidance out there. Please keep in mind that there are some seasonal impacts here for going forward here that we are going to see in our Q2, that’s kind of indicated in our guidance too. And that one have an impact on the international margins in our Q2 and as typical in that beginning up our Q3 also.', 'Jamie Cook', \"I'm sorry. What is the mix issue? Is it just more OE or can you just give color on that?\", 'Jon Marten', 'Well, it would be more of an ability as we look at some of the in rows that we are making and some of our businesses in Asia as well as in Europe making new wins getting more business and we are seeing good increases in our sales there for as -- much better than we had projected and that is really helping us to get more business and -- but that OE versus the aftermarket mix here is having a very, very slight impact.', 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay sorry, then just a question on the order inflections for North American International?', 'Lee Banks', \"Yes Jamie, it's Lee. I am going to answer your question and pivot on that too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterize the micro environment as we gave guidance in FY17. And what we talked about was basically we figured this to be a year where most of our market declines that we saw when we decelerate and eventually make it back or close to the flat.\", 'And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1 as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we’d see some small organic growth in year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. And we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in three buckets positive which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY17, neutral and then -- which would be neutral and then negative.', 'So it really hasn’t been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we’re still bullish on aerospace, we talked about refrigeration, air conditioning, semicon, and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas.', 'On a neutral front, we talked about automotive, we talked about power generation in rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about, which it really was a positive in our mind that we saw distribution moving to neutral, and what we see, we’re on track to do that. And I’ll comment on North America too for you when. And then negative year over year, which is consistent, it is decelerating for sure.', 'But whole natural resource and markets construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, and oil and gas. All have -- still have headwinds to them and then heavy duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call.', 'Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it’s down low single digits, it’s really in line with the expectations that saw. It’s definitely reaching all those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering and there are still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year, this time for some of these people. What I was encouraged about, is roughly every 4 years we hold a channel meeting in North America with our filed power channel. ', 'And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent two days just going from top to bottom networking, with everybody there and I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed about prospects moving forward. As you would expect areas like the great lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch were still suffering, but it’s not that accelerating rate of decline there is more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY17, so that was good.', 'If I talked about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas. And I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but do get a sense of there if there is a little bit a light at the end of tunnel and there are some talks about some projects happening going forward.', 'Energy markets is another one that we like, overall the large frame turbines was flat year over year but, I’ve talked about this in the past, that we’ve had some good specifications wins there, our content is up, so we’ve seen some strong numbers from that sector for us.', 'And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year over year declines in off-highway construction, equipment off-highway farming and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and railroad equipment. ', 'I’d say one market that was a little worse then we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say the automotive market is a little worse and really I’m talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of it has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year.', \"I’m going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you’re here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say again it’s a same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, if they have a large negative year over year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I’ll say a little bit of headwinds in some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter, we see that coming back. And then oil and gas still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe.\", 'General Industrial, Middle East has been strong for us. There is a lot of projects going on, result of their economic diversification efforts. So we’ve had some great project wins there and then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe and with off-highway construction equipment and heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe largely for international order standpoint largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter.', 'For Asia-Pacific we were encouraged by another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong, we’ve got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new win strategy and we like what’s happening there. And we’ve really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia.', 'Industrially we are up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery product power generation semiconductor, telecom all grew positive in Asia-Pacific. And then in mobile, I’ve highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us. Through some specification wins. We are doing very well there. And really increases in most segments in mobile off-highway construction again very low levels obviously, heavy duty truck farm and ag.', 'And then Latin America, another international component, again another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we’re encouraged by what’s happening there it’s been the first positive movement sometime. So when we think about countries like Brazil, coming back that’s a positive for us.', 'So international order entry accelerated stayed relatively in line, but if we thought in Europe accelerated in Asia, accelerated Latin America.', 'Jamie Cook', 'Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. I will get back in queue.', 'Lee Banks', 'Thanks, Jamie.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Can we just take a step back for a moment. I missed what you said about Turkey. Did you say Turkey was improving or Turkey was a bit of a headwind? You were talking about political activity.', 'Lee Banks', 'I was a little bit of disruptive there when all the political unrest was taking place, but it appears to us to be getting back in line and it was really some distribution business that went soft on us for a period of time.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay, that is helpful. And then Lat-Am orders accelerating. Can you just talk about where exactly you are seeing the demand? Is it distribution? Is it truck? Just a little bit of color in terms of specifically by market or by region?', 'Tom Williams', 'Yeah, I mean these are all very low level. So I don’t want to mischaracterize what’s happening there, but truck has been positive, construction equipment and really farm and ag has been the positive.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on your guidance. The dollar has strengthened against the euro by 4% since the end of the quarter. And I know you said you expect your outlook based on September 30 exchange rates. If you were to do your exchange rates as of today, would you have changed your revenue guidance?', 'Jon Marten', 'Ann this is Jon. I think yes I mean given that track and we have a pattern of a going through and using September 30. We will see how that kind of plays itself out for the balance of the year, but with the strengthening the dollar today I think that it would have an impact on the guidance very slightly.', 'Ann Duignan', 'Okay, I appreciate it. I will get back in line. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"First, I guess my first question, there has been a lot of concern especially as we have been exiting September that things in Industrial have started to get a little bit worse. And so I'm just curious whether you can provide any color on how things trended in the quarter and specifically that back half of September which has been a hot topic of conversation with folks?\", 'Tom Williams', 'Joe its Tom. So through the quarter what we saw was that North America orders get less negative, which is a good thing and seeing it progress sequentially that way to the quarter. Internationally and aerospace we are relatively consistent through the quarter. In October we haven’t seen I think that’s unusual and October is consistent with what we’ve put in the guidance.', 'Joe Ritchie', 'Okay. Helpful, Tom. And then maybe just given that the earnings number came in a little bit better than expected, Tom, you kind of kept the guidance range wide for the year. I think historically you guys have kind of narrowed in the first quarter. Just curious what your thoughts were around that especially just given the fact that order trends have gotten a little bit better?', 'Tom Williams', \"Yes, two things. One and maybe I will talk about the width of guidance, maybe people didn't pick up. We start -- we did this year in August different than what we have done historically. If you go back and look at our August guidance typically had a much wider range, so we started off the year with a more narrower than traditional range in August and we just kept that the same for the third quarter.\", 'So that part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level and the good thing about what happened in the quarters is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margins so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on that. We got some help below the line with some discrete one off things that are not going to repeat.', \"So we felt that with the mix holding it flat made sense and holding it flat especially in today's environment with the macro environment being I would still say fairly uncertain, but we are encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive. I would like to see a little bit more data before we get too far ahead of ourselves.\", 'Joe Ritchie', 'Got it. That makes sense. Maybe one last follow-up and this is specifically on the below the line items in the guide. I know you guys made a voluntary pension contribution. I assume that was going to be a little bit of a tailwind to your earnings number for this year, but it looks like your corporate number has gone up. And so what is the natural offset there?', 'Jon Marten', 'Yes I think the -- first of all it’s not a big tailwind, but it is a slight few cent tailwind there with that additional contribution that we made. Going on below the line, what would be going the other way as Tom has talked about and many of our different venues over the last several quarters. Our investments in R&D, our investments in ecommerce, our investments in IOT, and the kinds of things that we needed to in order to improve on our well customer experience is really driving the additional expenses here that are helping to offset that $0.05 or so impact that were getting from the additional pension contribution that we made. So I hope that helps you Jon.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"It's helpful Jon. Thanks guys.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.', 'Andy Casey', 'On the quarter could you give a little bit more color on the benefit to operating profit from restructuring and simplification?', 'Tom Williams', \"Andy, this is Tom. Maybe I will start strategically and I will let Jon add with the details in the quarter. But with simplification, the strategy here is really there is four elements of it and we’ve have a focus I would say initially, if you would envision simplification as kind of being an iceberg, the tip of iceberg was division consolidations that was kind of the natural thing out of the gate that we have did. But the bigger part of simplification was underneath that, it's going to product line complex, revenue complexity, organization design work, process changes that we’ll do related to that revenue complexity and there is good old-fashioned bureaucracy.\", 'So we are very encouraged because if you remember simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days and that’s a part of why you have seen from an operating margin standpoint why we perform so efficiently in the last several quarters, and why our decrementals have held up so well. But specifically within the quarter Jon has something more to add on that.', 'Jon Marten', 'Well the only thing that I would say on specifically in the quarter here is, we had $0.06 in restructuring that we actually book. We are going to see about -- we are maintaining our right guidance for the year and we are maintaining our saving that we have projected when we put our guidance together which is about 20% of the savings that we are going to get in the first half for the year.', \"So it kind of came right in along with our expectations, our actual restructuring that we booked in the quarter was a little bit lighter, few cents lighter than what we have projected in the guidance, it's actually $0.03 lighter than what we have projected in that guidance. But we are very pleased with our progress and we are maintaining that projection through the balance of the year.\", 'Andy Casey', 'Okay, thanks, Jon and Tom. If I step back a little bit from the quarter and look at the 2020 goals, you have mentioned confidence in achieving those. If I just isolate the 17% operating margin goal, can you comment on whether you can get there if the market stabilization happens but the markets kind of stay flat after that? Or do you need some end market growth in addition to the 150 basis point outgrowth that you are targeting?', 'Tom Williams', \"It's Tom again. So what we project including the 150 bips greater than the market is a 1.5% CAGR. Now remember the CAGR starts in ’15, so it went down from ’15 to ‘16 which is why that doesn’t sound like a really big number. So we go down because ’15 all the natural resource that dollar but then ’15 to ’16 flatting from ’16 to ’17 and starting grow by -- this time we get to FY20. Our expectation is to grow 150 basis point faster in the market based on FY20 as an exit rate.\", \"When you do the CAGR through that period of time it's 1.5%. So as a background, as long as the CAGR from ’15 to ’20 is a 100% CAGR we think we can get there 17% operating margin. Obviously if it’s lower than that, that’s does going to put challenges on it.\", 'But I think that’s a reasonable expectation given the macro environment, and our goal to gain share and all the other strategies we got around, the Win Strategy to grow fast in a market. So I think that’s fairly reasonable and we feel very comfortable that we can pull that off.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.', 'Joe Giordano', 'We have kind of touched on this but with the orders in North American Industrial getting slightly better on a comp basis, but the revenue was touched a little bit lower like 40 bps, did the order patterns even though it improved come in a little bit lighter than you might have thought?', 'Tom Williams', 'Joe, this is Tom so the sale gap that we have, which is very slight impacted, our guide around $40 million was pretty much equally dispersed between the three reporting segments, aerospace North America and international. So for Aerospace, it was little bit of biz jets softness helicopters, for North America a little softer, and heavy duty truck, automotive and little bit in the general industrial. Then international is mainly a little bit lighter in the Europe, then we had thought. But when you put it all together and based on their order trends that we’ve see and in fact that order trends are moving in the path we had thought they were going to go, we are encouraged, which is why we left the sales guidance flat for the full year.', 'Joe Giordano', \"I guess I was just referring to just on the sales guidance for North America, was touched down a little bit from prior. And orders seem to be getting a little bit better so I didn't know if that specifically -- if the cadence there was a little bit different than you might have thought? \", 'Tom Williams', 'Now these are only slight differences, Joe. We are only down a total of -- for the time period of 19 million for the year going forward were not down, all that much. And so this is us going through each one of our end markets, each one of our business pulling them all together and then coming up with some guidance that makes sense. But I would not read anything into that. Our orders are trending, just the way that we thought that they would. And so therefore we are making just very slight change in the sales as we’re projecting here in the guidance.', 'Joe Giordano', 'Fair enough. If I could just switch quickly to Aerospace for a bit, you mentioned the margins suffered a little bit from development costs. Can you maybe go into a little detail there? And then just two quarters in a row there 14% order growth and how much would you attribute that to comps getting progressively easier or are you seeing some real strength there?', 'Tom Williams', 'Well first on the development cost, I think from time to time, it’s very hard to project these quarter by quarter here and so these are more timing issues than they are anything else. Now on the 14% for two quarters in a row. I want to again -- as you know and everybody on the call knows, we are reporting these numbers because it’s long cycle business at a rolling 12 months average.', 'Now the long term growth rate that we can expect is what we’ve seen almost in the Q1 from aerospace there sales up 3.1%, and our long term growth rate with them is going forward is going to be in the 4% range. And that is something that overall a next 3 or 4 or 5 year timeframe, we feel very confident in saying. So I want to just caution you that to not expect a 14% increase going forward. This has to do with the lumpiness of the orders and how they come in from our military and commercial customers. And the long term prospects are fantastic, but they are not at translating to sales at a 14% per year annum rate.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Stephen Volkmann', \"Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think, Lee, when you sort of went around the horn on all the end markets, I didn't hear you mention anything regarding distributor inventory levels and maybe stocking is kind of waning or something, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. Anything to comment on there?\", 'Lee Banks', 'Steve, I don’t think it’s a big issue, I mean I’m sure there are some pockets out there, that aren’t apparent to me. But by and large that’s not something when I talk to the channel people that we’re worried about. I think a lot of that has worked its way out.', 'Stephen Volkmann', 'Okay, great. Maybe for Jon, it feels like we are sort of tweaking down the guidance I guess for fiscal second-quarter a little bit. Correct me if you disagree, but is there anything to call out for modeling purposes, any kind of below the line item stuff that maybe bounces back or how do we think about that?', 'Jon Marten', 'No, you’re right. I mean I think if there are some onetime events that Tom was talking about that happened in Q1, that was kind of good news for us, that are not going to repeat in Q2. You’re right, your observation is correct, it’s been tweak down just slightly. And there are no other new in different types of activities that are occurring here that would want to call out in a call like this. I think it’s a normal cost structure. Our cost structure is getting better, our volume is following a long our orders. Our orders are coming in the way that we had projected and so we are just a slight adjustments here for the slight bits of a good news here that we got in Q1, especially below the line.', 'Stephen Volkmann', 'Great. That is all I have got. Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Just back on simplification and the division consolidation, I mean you guys have done a great job early on. But Tom, you mentioned a lot of runway ahead. Can you maybe just speak to what are the really big opportunities as you go forward? And maybe along those lines just, Lee, you touched on international distribution maybe just expand on what you are doing there?', 'Tom Williams', 'So Jeff, its Tom. I’ll start with the simplification and Lee can talk about international distribution. For us I think the biggest pull in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue of complexity and when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple of percent of revenue it has a significant, and I would underlying significant amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that’s tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue.', 'Now, we don’t want to walk away from that, we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that’s a big element and because of the size of the company and then just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it’s going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we just now started scratching the surface of that.', 'Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through their product line complexity and simplify it, its old 80:20 type of concept. We are going to change organization design and processes associated and there will be speed, efficiencies, cost, et cetera. And in general an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us, that’s the other big part of the simplification is, is to make it easier to business with Parker.', 'We’ll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things then we will look at good old fashioned bureaucracy which Lee and I talked about it in the past, if you were to do our -- what used to be called internally in the Company, the Black Book of process which is our annual planning process. It was a process that would take 5 months, 20 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process and we drove that down to eight weeks, eight schedules and significantly freed up time for people.', \"So those are just an examples and color on that. We’re early days in this, but I think I would say it's got great momentum in the Company. So I’ll let Lee take over on what we’re doing on distribution internationally?\", 'Lee Banks', 'We have talked I mean many times that our distribution network is our greatest off-balance sheet asset that the company has and we have talked about North America being the gold standard in terms of how we compete and how we get to market. And when we’re putting the new Win Strategy together, although we had done a lot, we were cognizant that we still had not built this network out at the rate that we wanted to throughout the rest of the world. So as we rolled up the new Win Strategy we put a team of senior executives that know how to get this done, focusing on emerging regions in Europe and focusing on Asia Pacific. And we are really encouraged by the progress we are making 12 moths to 15 months into it right now. So very positive.', 'Jeffrey Hammond', 'Okay, thanks guys.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', \"Just a couple of questions of clarification first. I just wanted to make sure I had straight what Jon said about restructuring. You made a comment about 20%. I don't know Jon if you were saying 20% of a restructuring benefits are in the first half. If you could clarify that and then just a couple of follow-ups.\", 'Jon Marten', 'No you got that right, 20% of the savings that we get from the restructuring that we’re incurring for this year we will get in the first half, so yes.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', 'And then on Aerospace, obviously with these wins and orders you do have this development cost bubble. I’m wonder if you could just give us some sense of how elevated your R&D or E&D is today versus where you expect to see it say in that 2020 horizon?', 'Jon Marten', \"We are at the round numbers at about the 8% level today. We have as you know moved it down from 11% a few years ago. So the 7% to 8% range is the range that historically is a number that we are the most comfortable with. But overall our level of development cost are aligned with what our expectations are of our customers. If there is new and different types of requirements where we are the technical experts then we will be in many cases the designer of choice and that so will fluctuate, but for right now given today's environment 7% to 8% seems to be a right level for us and we are at about 8 right now.\", 'So if in could just have one more question and we will wrap it up for today. I hope that answers your question, Jeff.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Your line is open.', 'Alex Blanton', 'Just a question on the CapEx. The first quarter you had $32.5 million which is about 1.2% sales. That is about half of what you normally do which in turn is half as a percent of sales of what it was 10 years ago. What do you expect CapEx to be for the year? What percentage of sales?', 'Jon Marten', 'It will be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 for the year. So 1.6 to 2.0 CapEx as a percent of sales.', 'Alex Blanton', 'Okay, so that is going to be a pretty low figure compared with what you were 10 years ago.', 'Jon Marten', 'We are not nowhere near as required capital that we did 10 years ago Alex, and that 1.6 to 2.0 includes a lot of reinvestments into the company, but no you are right we are nowhere near where we five years ago, let alone 10.', 'Alex Blanton', 'And that is mainly due to the lean efforts, correct?', 'Jon Marten', \"Yes, it's hard to articulate on the phone call like this, how much lean has transformed our company. And when you add on to that all these affords that we are going through from a business simplification standpoint and how that’s impacting our CapEx plans, we are just seeing a lot of great momentum from that. And so yes, that’s correct.\", 'Alex Blanton', 'So is it just a matter of raising your margins, [indiscernible] profits, the higher profits [indiscernible], when it comes to allocating it to CapEx and [indiscernible] acquisitions?', 'Jon Marten', 'Yes, we are from a CapEx standpoint we feel very good about our positioning there and of course we are discipline, we are using in a IRR approach on that just as we do on the DCS from an acquisition standpoint. And we remain disciplined on all of our right capital allocation plans. And that’s our goal, as Tom said we want to be great deployers of the cash going forward. So I hope that helps you out, Alex.', 'Alex Blanton', \"I just have one suggestion on the slide that you list your cash flow -- I guess it is slide number -- cash flow from operating activities, Slide 12. I would give a simplified cash flow statement actually there. You are not presenting the individual components, the major components of cash flow and I realize that is in the cash flow statement in the operating statements, but it would be very helpful to have it right here on this slide so people could see it and wouldn't have to refer back to the cash flow statement. Just a simplified one showing the CapEx, showing changes in inventory and the working capital and so on.\", 'Jon Marten', 'Okay, well that’s a [multiple speakers] yes, no good suggestion Alex, we will definitely take that one on and take a real hard look at that for you and all of our investors.

We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance. And finally share progress we are making with the new win strategy.\", 'Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter first I’d like to talk about the safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority and as such we start our meetings at Parker with the discussion on safety. So I thought I’d start our earnings call with safety as well.', 'During the first quarter of 2017 we are able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year over year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. And actually we have a long way to go, to reach our goal of zero accidents. But I’m very pleased with the progress we’re making. Safety is important because, not only does it protect our people but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. ', 'Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were 2.74 billion, a 4% declined compared with the same quarter year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic.', 'Total order rates in the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in order since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering and our aerospace systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforced our previously communicated view that we’re progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets.', 'However we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up. Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to 2010 million on an as reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis. A 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share, compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. ', 'This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 base point improvement, year-over-year in the adjusted segment operating margins. Our decremented margin return on sales or MROS was 3.9% for the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter. That our adjusted decremented have been below 30%.', \"It was another strong quarter for cash flow, cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter we've repurchased $115 million in Parker's stock, this completes the previous announced commitment to buyback a minimum of $2 billion in Parker’s shares of October 2016. Going forward our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deplorer of cash, in a way that generates increased long term returns for our shareholders.\", 'Now regarding FY17 guidance. We continue to forecasting a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017 we are maintaining guidance or as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10, or middle point at $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. ', 'So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We will continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across four broad goals, engaging people, premier customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.', 'Our ongoing execution with new Win Strategy through its first full year implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of our 150 basis points. Higher then a rate of global industrial products. We’re also targeting 17% segment operating margins and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compounding of growth rate and earnings per share of 8% over this 5 year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable, long term value of Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders.', 'I’ll now hand things back Jon to review more details on the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance.', 'Jon Marten', \"Thanks, Tom. And at this time please refer to Slide 5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.\", \"Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year. On Slide 6 we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year, increase to adjusted earnings per share include a reduction of corporate G&A expense which totaled $0.11 per share.\", \"A lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16, lower interest expense and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share re-purchase activity which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share, a reduction of $0.08 per share and income was a result of the lower adjusted segment operating income driven by weakened end market topline demand as projected while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share.\", 'Moving to Slide 7, with the review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost incurred in the quarter was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.', \"Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.\", \"Moving to Slide 8, I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.\", 'Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million, as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million, as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.', \"I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial Segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the industrial international segment decreased by 3.2%, acquisition positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margins for the first quarter adjusted for business, realignment cost was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.\", 'Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled 7 million as compared to 12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 144 million as compared to 141 million which despite the weakened topline reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.', 'I’ll now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace System segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter, neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues, growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year.', 'Operating margin for the first quarter adjusted for realignment cost was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter, compared to 2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was 73 million as compared to 76 million reflecting the timing impact of higher development cost during the quarter.', 'Moving to Slide 11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The diversified industrial segment report on a three month rolling average while aerospace systems are based on a 12 month rolling average. Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter end reflecting easing year ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets.', 'Diversified industrial North America orders decrease year-over-year to negative four, diversified industrial international orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive three and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.', 'On Slide 12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter cash flow from operating activities was 114 million or 4.2% of sales, this compares to 0.7% of sales with the same period last year. When adjusted with $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter cash for operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution in May last year.', \"The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $150 million for the Company's repurchase of common shares, and 85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. 33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter is also called out.\", \"Turning to Slide 13, the full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance has been provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of 48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting. \", 'Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat and acquisitions and the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 8.4% currency and guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance FY17.', 'For Total Parker as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2 -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY16 margins, 13.9% on an as reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY16.', 'The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate G&A interest in other expense is 478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%, the average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. ', 'For the full year, the guidance range on an as reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY17.', 'The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be 30 million and are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for proposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison.', 'Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half. EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 and the midpoint, that’s first half versus second half.

Mike?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Great. Thanks Janet. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution, that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment.', 'Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all time records. Particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the industrial segment, and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to over deliver on our commitments, despite lower than forecasted revenues.', \"Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, that's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19, so adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better [ph] than our guidance midpoint.\", 'Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. About half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. That translates to a couple of cents headwinds versus our earnings guidance. The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending, as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance.', 'Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses, as well as residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency remain strong. Ex-currency, Latin America was down low single digits, with strong results in Mexico, partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency in Asia, revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets.', 'Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, organic revenue and industrial was down 2%. As you will see when I get to the forecast, we adjust our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower industrial markets and currency.', 'Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in transport against record orders in 2014, as well as a slowdown in industrial. Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange were up low single digits and were up mid-single digits in North America.', 'Adjusted operating margins increased one full percentage point, a stronger productivity and pricing combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter, and have completed our announced 250 million of share repurchase in early October.', 'And I will turn it over to Sue, and then I will come back to take you through the fourth quarter outlook.', 'Sue Carter', \"Thanks Mike. Let's go to slide 4 please; orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis, and up 3% excluding currencies, on an organic basis which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency.\", 'Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens. Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American transport and in marine. Organic orders for industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by low single digits in Club Car.', 'Please go to slide 5; just a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis, and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I will give more color on each segment in just a few slides.', 'The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 3%.', \"Let's go to slide 6 please; this chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, of 13% to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix.\", 'Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year, from material deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points, driven by strong productivity and cost containments. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points.', 'That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend control.', \"Let's go to slide 7 please; the climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8%, ex-currency.\", 'Third quarter organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year, and increased by high teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat.', 'The North American residential HVAC market continued in orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens, ex-currency, with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens.', \"Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to productivity and volume/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.\", 'Please go to slide 8; third quarter revenues for the industrial segments were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also 2% organically, as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from parts and service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investment.\", 'Please go to slide 9; for the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some pre-build of inventories prior to ERP system go lives, which went live in October, without event.', 'Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year.', 'Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income targets for cash generation.', 'And with that, I will turn it back to Mike.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Great. Thanks Sue and please go to slide 10; North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There is no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid to high single digit growth for 2015 in North America and commercial HVAC markets.', 'The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the [indiscernible] that occurred in the back part of 2014.', 'To [Indiscernible] North American climate segment markets, we expect North American transport market to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year. North American industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits.', 'We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid single digits at constant currency, from flat to down, after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia has slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year.', 'We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year.', 'Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we are reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said, really $50 million of that happened in the third quarter.', 'Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about four percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about three points for the year. Organic growth, ex-currency and acquisitions remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July.', 'We expect climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change to climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million, and its mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July, and reflects continued weakness in China.', 'For the industrial segment, revenues are now forecast in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis; which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. Its almost all from lower volumes, that short cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment pushouts on larger machines. You might recall, that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in industrial in the second half, the new forecast reflects about 2% contraction in organic growth in the second half and industrial.', 'Within the industrial segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter, and a continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect climate margins to be in the range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margin to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance. This higher productivity and the continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volume.', 'Please go to slide 11; our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year, down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we are entering the fourth quarter with and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken and that will continue. The range for reported or GAAP [indiscernible] EPS is $2.57 to $2.62. Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition.', 'Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela, including these, the reported EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92.', 'We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter and the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast will put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75%, at about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter, and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year.', \"Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning, naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us six years ago. He has been instrumental in our value stream transformation and in the development of the company's first operating system, which is the foundation for the company's birth in operational excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success and strategy implementation makes them highly qualified and serve as the compressed air system and services business President.\", \"Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President of Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our operational excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll-Rand seven years ago, and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the global integrated supply chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the climate solutions and industrial technology sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd.\", 'These changes reflect our commitment to premier performance, aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans.', \"So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a five year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance, will be a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow, with a further implementation of our strategies. We have already taken and will continue to take actions to generate growth and earnings, as needed to respond to market conditions.\", 'And so with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.', 'Nigel Coe', 'Good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Good morning Nigel.', 'Sue Carter', 'Good morning.', 'Nigel Coe', 'So let me start off with the change amendments for the industrial segment. Congratulations to Todd and Keith in their new roles. I am just wondering, what if anything changes in terms of the [indiscernible] for industrial tech, and to [indiscernible] the question Mike, is that -- the margins, the trickle of investor retention [ph] and I am just wondering, is that a recognition, given all the background that perhaps there should be a sharp focus on productivity and cost containment there?', 'Mike Lamach', \"Well looking at the opportunities, Nigel, and we are dead committed to the 70% and 90% operating margins that we have communicated in the past. We want to accelerate that as quickly as possible, and for the segment to achieve that, we have got to achieve that [indiscernible] that business, first and foremost. So the effort here would be certainly on all of the growth and operational excellence activities in the company. We see great opportunity in the value stream work, and reaccelerating that. So its really -- I think, a tribute to Todd's leadership, but also to a commitment to being on-track and getting ourselves on track for that business.\", 'Nigel Coe', 'Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-on there, Mike. The 50 bips of price cost benefit this quarter, consistent with commentary, but I think probably a little bit better than certainly what we expected. As that continues to get better, as the hedges start to roll off on the copper and aluminum, or is this a pretty good run rate from here?', 'Sue Carter', \"Nigel, let's think about the cost or the price and material from a longer term perspective. So what we would have is a -- we'd have a total average spread between direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. What we said when we talked in July, was that in the second half of 2015, we would see wider spreads, because the material deflation was really kicking in, which is exactly what we saw in that 60 bips spread.\", \"But in general, we are still targeting about 30 percentage points of spread for the year, then as we look at, going forward, we'd hang on to that goal of having a positive spread of 20 to 30 basis points. So I don't think that edge moves up forward, at least in the near term, that 2016 commodities are going to increase. We have got about 50% of our copper for 2016 locked in. However, I think its more realistic to think about the overall spread being 20 to 30 basis points, rather than a 60 basis point spread being a normal. I don't think that works [ph].\", 'Nigel Coe', 'Okay, great. Thanks a lot.', 'Mike Lamach', 'I think Nigel, more than we though really, but we kind of thought 50, it was 60. So its pretty close to the number that we had thought.', 'Nigel Coe', 'Okay. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', \"Thank you. Good morning guys and ladies. Just quickly on Cameron and just the M&A impact. Just wanted to check my math, it sounds like you've actually held your Cameron forecast? If I am assuming a 3% acquisition contribution, that would imply about $380 million in revenues and back out [indiscernible], it was like 340-ish for Cameron. It sounds like no change there, but then Mike, you also made a comment about de-risking Cameron a little bit. So can you just reconcile that or am I missing something in that math?\", 'Mike Lamach', 'Jeff, great question. Let me walk through. So I talked about the fact that we reduced the back half for you in total for the company by $140 million. $50 million of that would have happened in Q3, so $90 million relating to Q4. Also [indiscernible], there was regular change to the climate, really the top $30 million, leaving $60 million in the industrial businesses. We think about the Cameron piece of large machines, and we took a $20 million to $25 million view of risk on that, saying that, we know of some instances and perhaps will know some more delays for oftentimes customer acceptance or readiness on those sides. So think about $20 million, $25 million being associated with big machines.', 'The balance of that could be split 50-50 between all of what the short cycle replenishment is in industrial and FX again. So if you look at sort of the Cameron piece of this, on the large machine exposure, 20-25, and then if you look at just short cycle of recovery, some of that would be plant there, for both Ingersoll-Rand legacy and Cameron, it would be the normal smaller plant there. We are not seeing the order rates returning there, we are seeing some slowdown of capital spending from industrial customers in Q3 and Q4, and so there is a bit of that in there as well.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', 'Okay. And then, just shifting gears on TK, orders down on tough comps, but the comps are going to stay tough, right, in North America, in particular in trailer. How do you see things playing out? Should we still be thinking about double digit type decline or more in trailer in North America in 2016?', 'Sue Carter', \"So Jeff, let me give that a shot. So you're right, as we look at the order rates for North America for trailer in the third quarter, they declined. Again, we expected that, we talked about some of those orders being roughly at peak in the second quarter, and it really is a tough compare to 2014. So when we look at the fourth quarter, so first I will take fourth quarter, we expect the trailer orders again to show negative year-over-year comparisons, again, based on really strong 2014, actually record order levels last year.\", \"So what we are looking at is, the tough comparisons on TK in total, orders for the third quarter and overseas markets were actually down, and ex-currency were roughly flat. But you also asked a question about 2016. So if we look at what's out there in terms of ACT data. So we are not telling you about your forecast. So we are looking at ACT data. We still are seeing forecast for that to come down in the ranges of probably some of those double digits. But we are closely assessing the markets, especially in trailer and in looking at the record volume. So not really a precise answer, but the tough comps are really the big part of the story, and in 2016, ACT doesn't see much change from the prior outlooks.\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Jeff, if you took that kind of 15% kind of the -- sort of the market for North American trailer. I recognize, it’s a little bit less than 25% of our business. We are probably going to see pretty good markets in Europe and Middle East. We are seeing probably good markets for marines, rail, bus and for our air, refrigeration businesses that we talked about a scenario last time that, a 10% to 15% decline in North American trailer, is something that we think we could still grow margins, in the TK business, and potentially, actually grow the top line. But that's not to be concluded until we finalize the plan.\", 'Jeffrey Sprague', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.', 'Steven Winoker', 'Thanks and good morning all. Just to clarify that answer for Jeff. On the Cameron deal, you had originally promised $0.8 to $0.10 of gross accretion for 2015. So bottom line like, where is that -- what number it looks like you are going to achieve this year on that?', 'Mike Lamach', 'So cash accretion so at about $0.08 -- maybe a little bit better, but about $0.08.', 'Steven Winoker', \"Okay, great. And then on the restocking impact in resi and destocking across industrial. What are you seeing -- what kind of impact do you think that's having on the business?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well residential is lumpy. You know Steve, it's hard for a quarter-to-quarter compare with all that's happened with the change in [indiscernible] regulations. Our global residential business was up mid-teens, but our North American residential bookings were up high teens. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into the booking numbers, and some of the anomalies from quarter-to-quarter.\", 'The industrial restocking, is just more of an indication of slowing industrial markets, and as a fact that companies like ours are probably pulling in a bit on CapEx and we see our service businesses growing. So one thing you see in a typically mild pull back in your commercial-industrial phase, is that service business should grow. And our service business grew mid-single digits and mid single digits in industrial, which is a pretty good performance.', 'Steven Winoker', 'Okay. And then just following up your point about 30 basis points ongoing prices versus raws, and if I think about same growth rate maybe next year as this year for the overall business, if that were to be the case. Do you think you can hold these kinds of mid-40s organic incrementals?', 'Sue Carter', 'I think if we look at really more along the lines of what we have said longer term, which is -- we are comfortable with looking at incrementals that are -- and our gross margin levels, as opposed to trying to project what happens to all of those. And I understand the comment on deflation and the productivity that we have had, but I think there is going to be some other areas that are going to have even tougher comps in 2016 going forward. So I think, the price spread of 20 to 30 bips and our incremental leverage being at gross margin levels, have probably got a longer term weight of just thinking about the business.', 'Steven Winoker', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.', 'Deane Dray', 'Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping Sue could clarify the comment on expectations for -- did you say inventory increasing in the fourth quarter, and its impact on your free cash flow conversion?', 'Sue Carter', 'Right. So I am hoping that our inventory does not increase in the fourth quarter. What I meant, and hopefully what I said is, right now, our inventory levels are higher than what we would have seen a year ago. Part of that is, because of the build-up of the air compressor inventory for Q4 shipment. Part of that is the pre-build for the ERP go-live and some other impacts from -- actually the revenue decreasing.', \"But what I expect to see in the fourth quarter, is I expect to see the inventory come down, but the comment is that I don't really expect it to get back to the previous levels, or year ago levels at the end of 2015. So we will continue to work all of that off, it doesn't mean it's an issue, it just means its going to be slightly heavier. And what we have done, to answer your question, on a free cash flow basis, is that we did -- our original range was $950 million to $1 billion, we said roughly $950 million at this point in time, and what we are doing from a free cash flow perspective, is that everything that you might expect us to do, which is, we are overdriving performance on receivables. We are looking at all the things that make sense, in terms of being tight on all the other elements of free cash flow to make up for the fact that we have got a little more inventory than what we had a year ago.\", \"So I don't think any of this is an issue. I think our free cash flow, being at 98% and sort of projected net income is running in line with where we'd like it to be. So I don't think it’s a problem, I think its just going to be a little higher than it was a year ago.\", 'Deane Dray', 'Sue, I appreciate the clarity. And Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the European strength in climate. Did that surprise you at all? How much is fix a factor there, and it looks like you could be getting some share gains?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Well it is surprising us for a couple of years in terms of just the success I think we have had. But as I said in the past, we have got an excellent team, bringing new business and a lot of new products and services being launched into the marketplace. So continued good performance there.', 'Deane Dray', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Julian Mitchell', \"Thank you. Just a question on industrial. I think you're guiding for Q4 organically to be down about the same degree in revenues as Q3, so maybe down about 2% year-on-year. But the orders progression has got worse, Q3 versus Q2 and the organic sales hurdle is higher in Q4. So maybe just confirm is that's really the case, and maybe talk a little bit about how you are seeing industrial demand trending kind of within the quarter and in the last couple of months, specifically?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"The [indiscernible] Julian that we have really is in China, which really runs a pretty wide range of worst case, best case. And so, we are taking something out of a more conservative range in China at this point, and that's really the wildcard. The balance of it really is just sort of the book in turn that we know of and conservative views now on restocking into some of the stock businesses.\", 'Sue Carter', \"And I would say Julian, you are right. When we talked in July, we have seen some short cycle markets recover in June. Some, but its not all certainly, and that reacceleration didn't continue in the third quarter, as we had anticipated, and we did lower our industrial growth outlook for the second half from plus 2% to minus 2%. So you are absolutely right.\", 'Julian Mitchell', 'Got it. I guess, you are not expecting the decline to get worse in Q4, even though you have a tougher comp in industrial?', 'Mike Lamach', 'We had a little bit of a surprise favorability in bookings in Latin America in the compressor business, a bit of a surprise. And again, we think, we have taken a conservative view and China team has a roadmap on some larger orders that could close. But I think we have got this tackled with the 90 million in the back half, 60 million of it really being attributed to -- I am sorry, the fourth quarter, $90 million for the company, $60 million in industrial. We think we have got it covered here with what we know today.', 'Julian Mitchell', 'Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on Trane in Asia. I think obviously, the trends, even back in July, were pretty unsteady in China. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you have seen the order intake in the backlog moving there?', 'Sue Carter', \"So let's just kind of talk about china in general. So obviously, economic growth rate, significantly below the historic rates, with the government attempting to rebalance the economy and all of those different pieces. Some of that is not smooth, some of it is lumpy and so some of the comparisons get a little bit volatile, if you just go from quarter-to-quarter. But if we look at HVAC bookings in China for the quarter, they were actually up low single digits versus last year. And for the quarter, HVAC revenues in China -- for the fourth quarter, the HVAC revenues in China are expected to be down low single digits, and part of that is applied systems and the growth there being more than offset by lower unitary revenues and currency. And so, there is a lot of different pieces that are moving around. If we just look at non-residential construction markets start in the fourth quarter last year, some of that continued into the second half of 2015. Some of the areas of strength or verticals, where we do see some growth would be data centers, healthcare, and mix development opportunity.\", 'Mike Lamach', 'Good news there Julian, was the fourth quarter positive bookings and HVAC in China.', 'Julian Mitchell', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', \"Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Hey Shannon.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Mike, so just on the -- to clarify the leverage point in the fourth quarter. I think you said corporate going down $15 million to $60 million. Is there some other maybe offset below the line and other income or anything that we should be aware of? It just seems like, I end up a little high, if corporate goes down $15 million?', 'Sue Carter', \"Well so when you think about the fourth quarter leverage and the different pieces, in the spot where you are going to look at and what's happening, if organic growth is going to be in the range of 2% to 3%, so you have got $75 million to $80 million of revenue. If you have got productivity and direct material inflation, we are still continuing to get price, and if those are the primary drivers of productivity in the fourth quarter, and you have lower corporate. To your point, the math does work out to be in the 75% to 80% range for the fourth quarter.\", 'Mike Lamach', 'Shannon, another way to look at it, $75 million of revenue at the midpoint, $40 million NOI on that, take $15 million off that for corporate, now you are talking about nearly $25 million on $75 million. You have got 33% leverage and look at the price deflation spread, look at the productivity of our other inflation spread, and its really a doable number.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Okay. And there is nothing -- I know your other line moves around, there is nothing different going on there. It has been bouncing all over the place, something I had to model, [indiscernible] currency, but do you have anything moving significantly down the other line?', 'Sue Carter', 'No. So the fourth quarter should be relatively flat. So not really a lot of movement there that we are looking at.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Just on the commercial HVAC bookings, up mid-single digits in the Americas, do you have sort of the North America split of that? I think you used to give, and is there any parts of North America you see getting better or worse?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Applied is trending, as we said, applied, mid single, its sort of the institutional piece of that large unitary that applied to institutional is -- in fact, the larger unitary is doing really well. The open backlog [ph] sort of matches what the booking trends looks like, which gives us some sense that -- to think about open quote [ph] got predating bookings by three to six months. The rates stay fairly consistent going into 2016. So I think that its shaping up like the though, which is this mid-single digit institutional recovery that should last a few years. That state is still quite a bit more aggressive, and that you are showing institutional put in place 2016 versus 2015, 14%, starts at 10%. But I think as you all know, historically been fairly high, it comes down throughout the year.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.', 'Steve Tusa', \"Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Shannon's question. Can you just kind of give us the approximate margins? There are some rounding dynamics here, and you guys got some squiggly lines next to the numbers annually, and so I am just having a little bit of trouble again getting kind of low enough for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us more rough approximation of what the 4Q is for the segments? Margin-wise?\", 'Sue Carter', 'So if we are looking at the total year for industrial being in the range of 13% or roughly 14%. So you are right, we have got a little bit of a squiggle in there. What that would imply for the fourth quarter on industrial, is margins in sort of the 15.5-ish type of range. And part of that gets driven by the compressor shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as continued productivity and lower inflationary type environment.', 'Steve Tusa', 'Okay. And then for climate, I think we are backing it into something around 13.5%? Is that about right?', 'Sue Carter', 'So climate, with the sort of 13 that we are looking at for the full year, would be -- if you backed into a -- that climate midpoint would be just a smidge under the 13 range for the fourth quarter?', 'Steve Tusa', \"Okay. Then that makes more sense. And last question, just on the resi dynamics, what will mix contribute this year? I don't think you guys had great mix in the second quarter, like maybe some others did? There maybe different timing dynamics around how much 14-SEER you are now selling? How much of that 14-SEER transition is booked this year, and then how much is kind of still yet to come for next year?\", 'Mike Lamach', 'We have some negative mix, Steve, in the year with 14-SEER, which works itself out this year. But we think that generally 14 is accretive [ph] to 13 and we are seeing really good margin expansion in the res business. So in spite of the mix down of 14 for us, good absorption, good expansion, and work itself through in 2015.', 'Steve Tusa', 'And then for 2016, is there still some benefit to come in [ph]?', 'Mike Lamach', \"I think there is better -- I don't think have got the issue of mixing down in 2016. I mean, there could be a quarter, four or five months that -- you have to take with -- these dynamics of the change this year, in terms of stocking 13-SEER. For the most part, I think we should be having a pretty clean year, next year, in terms of mix.\", 'Steve Tusa', 'Okay, great. Thanks.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.', 'Robert McCarthy', 'Good morning everyone. I guess the first question I would have, is just, taking into account some of the comments around state of the U.S. non-resi and the limited visibility on the industrial side. I mean, how do you think about directionally about 2016 in terms of EPS growth, and what can you provide in addition, maybe for CapEx or -- you have provided some incremental margins. So what can you provide about 2016, how we should be thinking about it?', 'Mike Lamach', 'I mean, first of all, remember, we will do it from February, so I will give just some general sense of where things are going. But before I do that, step back for a minute and we look at 75% of the companies being in the climate segment. Of that, really 60% of the company is HVAC and more than 60% of that is in North America. So you have got, really 40% of the company, with pretty strong growth dynamics going into 2016.', 'I think HVAC in Europe, Eastern Europe, even potentially the Middle East will be growth organically for us, probably not the same rate of course as North America. But you have got that growing. So in essence, a large part of the business is growing for us.', 'When you think about industrial; I think that Asia, Latin America, continue to be a bit of a struggle and maybe some currency headwind coming at us. But net-net, we see that even with low growth next year, we will expand margins nicely. I am not going to give you an EPS number today, but we certainly feel like there is an opportunity with the pockets we are seeing at growth in 2015 [indiscernible].', 'Robert McCarthy', 'Okay. And then just one follow-up; in terms of just capital allocation and then just reinvestment in the business, given the prevailing environment. Certain change or nuance of the margin in terms of M&A or other forms of capital redeployment or internal reinvestment?', 'Sue Carter', 'No. When we look at it, we expect to continue the balance capital allocation that we have got. We have investment in our businesses. We can expect continue having a strong dividend payout. So in the 30% to 35% range, we will continue to, at a minimum, offset dilution with share repurchase activities. And then, the remainder of it, we will basically continue to toggle between value accretive M&A and additional share repurchase and just evaluate what makes the most sense at any given point in time.', \"Now, you had also asked about CapEx, and so generally speaking, our CapEx is usually in the range of about $250 million, which is roughly equal to depreciation, and we don't expect that to change going forward either.\", 'Mike Lamach', 'The CapEx and investments are a number, that Robert, we can work with during the -- depending on what we see in terms of the environment. There is some flexibility for us to spend less, if we need to -- to help us on the EPS commitments that we will make.', 'Robert McCarthy', 'Thanks for your time.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.', 'Josh Pokrzywinski', 'Hi good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Hey Josh.', 'Josh Pokrzywinski', 'Just a couple of questions, first on Cameron; obviously backlog is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, but can you give us maybe an indication on how order trends and visibility or coverage into next year looks, maybe versus what normal seasonality should look like? They are obviously [indiscernible] to the year yet, but just kind of any color on orders would be helpful?', 'Sue Carter', \"Sure Josh. One of the interesting things about the history and what happened in that engineered compressor business, is that not only are shipments back half loaded, but generally, orders in the launch engineered compressors are also back half loaded. So we are seeing real time, what's happening in the different places in the market. So let me give you a little color on what I think we are seeing, and how that translates into what we see for 2016.\", 'So in general, you are going to look at this space being negatively impacted by all of the oil and gas majors are going to put [ph] in capital, 20% to 30%. There is industry consolidation. EPC activity is slowed, and so when you think about projects, there is probably, in general, fewer projects. Same number of competitors, which means that you need to be really sharp, you need to be really focused, and really work at the orders.', \"Now, having said that, if I break down the different pieces of the business. So on processed gas, which is roughly a quarter of the business; there is still some growth from the natural gas side of things, and LNG. There are some Middle East project delays. However, you have got petrochemical doing okay. Power-gen, particularly in Europe being an area where, there are some projects and things that we can look at, and so, when we think about the processed gas, one of the things that you can start to think about, is on the chemical side or petrochemicals, is the lower gas price, give you a lower feedstock price and that could change some of those dynamics. I don't know.\", \"But its still a tough environment, as I said fewer projects and some things happening. Engineer, air, so another quarter of the business, you have still got air separation, particularly in the China market, that to be honest, I don't see changing any time soon. There is going to be some activity, but there is going to be a lot lower activity, and if you looked in just, what's happening from, industrial gas businesses and activity, you'd see lower activity in the first half versus 2014 and 2015, and I am not sure that that changes. And again, that industry, looking at projects where we might take place with some of that engineered air product, with air separation, you have got over capacity, lower steel demand and all of that.\", 'In plant there, which is -- we can turn pieces of business. Its roughly flat versus 2014. There are still some good markets out there, with auto, food and beverage. Europe is a little slower on that side and Asia is down, and then the aftermarket for the business is where opportunity still exists. And so in general, you have got softer markets, still some projects moving forward. But we are in the period, when a lot of the orders take place. So we have got our eye on what happens in 2016 with all the different pieces.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Synergy-wise too Josh, we are really on track with -- as an example, just sort of the plant there, the rent synergies and the cost synergies, and if anything over the last few months, we have gotten a sort of even more conviction around the opportunity for the engineering, supply chain and manufacturing synergies that could exist in the business.', 'So I think that we will continue to make the business accretive and in 2016, we will make sure that if we got the weakness. [Indiscernible] who is talking about, that we have got a response to keep the margins at or better than when they were this year. And we got a roadmap to do that.', 'Sue Carter', 'And I think the bottom line of all of that is, its still a great business and its still a great product for us. And like I said, in spite of all of the things that I said about the market, its accretive in 2015, and we are getting the synergies. So more to come on this one.', 'Josh Pokrzywinski', \"That's great detail. And if I could just ask a follow-up on TK, I have heard that some of the trailer guys have opened up the order books, maybe a month or so early than they normally would for the following year. Is that something you guys have seen, and is any of the strength in North America this quarter, and maybe a month or so [indiscernible] had from what you might normally have seasonally?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well, clearly [indiscernible] which customers opened up their order books and whose customers they are. So you could take the top 10 customers, they are going to order at different points in time. But I would say that, in the third quarter, you had some customers that open up their order books, and we have seen the same thing happen in the past, where there is a little bit of an anomaly between who is ordering. So we are -- whose order and who is left to order, and I don't think you're seeing a lot of dynamic shift in that. But you will see differences in book rates and revenue rates depending on when that occurs. Some of these guys will buy 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 units, and so it makes a difference when you are looking at 6,000 to 8,000 unit month, which we is what we have been saying the last few months.\", 'Josh Pokrzywinski', 'Got you. All right. Appreciate. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.', 'Andrew Obin', 'Yeah, good morning guys.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Good morning Andrew.', 'Andrew Obin', 'Nice quarter in this doom and gloom environment. Just a question; there was some debate inside the company about how to look at the value stream process, and at the Analyst Day, you have indicated that you are reassessing your approach, because you have sort of touched a lot of low hanging fruit. And then, we seemed to have had a pause in execution last quarter and this quarter operating leverage just seemed to have come through very nicely. Can you describe to us what internal operating changes you have been implementing over the past six months to address this next level of operating improvement.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Yeah, a lot Andrew. I am not sure I will cover it here, it would be a great discussion that we could have when we get together for our review this spring, in general. But we have used this product growth team as a basis to expand the effort across the company. We have continued to now touch really all of the business with the value streams. Sourcing has become, I think, mature across the company. We have got really good productivity last three quarters, really in general. If you look past Q2 and kind of look at the last three quarters, we are seeing productivity accelerate.', \"Its never really that linear. I know we'd all like for it to be, but its not. We have projects and ideas that, at a certain point in time, kick in a quarter, and those make a difference. Higher volumes would make even a more positive difference of course. So we are doing this all with actually quite sort of low volumes than some of our businesses. So we are excited, as volumes do return, we'd see even better productivity and the change that we have made.\", \"And so, look, I think that we haven't really changed the operating system in five years, we have just really looked across as product growth teams, and now have touched most or all the companies in one way shape or form.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'And just a follow-up question, I apologize if you have answered it already. But can you comment on cadence of industrial orders throughout the quarter?', 'Mike Lamach', \"Cadence throughout the quarter, there really weren't any sort of high spots in the quarter to say. They were choppy, they were just sort of low in the entire quarter. We had pretty good growth in our fleet management business, obviously which was a highlight for us. It was kind of a double digit grower there, it's a good sign. But material handling, which is really our only oil exposed business, significant declines of 50% in bookings in that business from prior year. So inside industrial, when you move the compressor business out of the way and you look at some of the smaller businesses, there are some high and low points, that generally speaking, pretty explainable if you look at material handling as a good example of that.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'Terrific. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.', 'Joe Ritchie', 'Thanks and good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Hi Joe.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"So a quick clarification. Mike, you mentioned earlier the dodge [ph] data on the institutional side, and your expectations for next year. But there is not a lot of noise in the data, especially on the commercial side. I am just curious, what if anything you're seeing and what you're making of that noise on the unitary side of your business?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well, I think that the large unitary business continues to do well, because, there is also a lot of large unitary that's split into more of the institutional environment. So that continues.\", 'Actually the commercial activity has been fairly strong. If you split up commercial-industrial, industrial has probably been just a little bit weaker in North America. But not a bad environment frankly at all for us. So we continue to think it’s a pretty good North American market, for both institutional and industrial. But in terms of strength going forward, its really institutional than commercial, and then industrial HVAC kind of trending in that direction.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe following up on that, how do you think about mix then, as you head into next year? Clearly, we talked a little bit about some North America headwinds on TK. But some of the mix headwinds on resi sits aside. How are you guys thinking about mix? Particularly, in light of the climate margin target of 13% to 14% for 2016?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well I mean, on track in a nutshell, Joe. I mean, TK still gives us really good volumes from a profitability perspective, working with pretty high volumes across the board. Even though the year-over-year decrease in the market will be there, we have got plenty of gas left there and grow parts of the business that we didn't have last time around. So we feel pretty good about being able to hold their head up on the TK business. As you look at a climate, great expansion in margins, in the res business. I have said before, I will say again, mid-teens, mid-teens plus EBITDA. The commercial business, particularly in Europe is doing well, and we are hitting some critical mass there, and I think we will begin to contribute more to that margins across the business.\", 'And then in general, North America just does a really good job in terms of share and consistent margin expansion there. So feel pretty good about that. The wildcards are really Latin America and Asia for us, as it relates to HVAC businesses.', \"And here, we talk about pricing in China, but its not sort of an environment that's impossible, its just more difficult for us. So we are persevering in China, and again, we feel good at least about the quarter, bookings going in the right direction. We'd love to see next couple of quarters, look the same way before we feel more constructive about China -- about Asia in general.\", 'Joe Ritchie', 'Okay, thanks. I will get back in queue.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Janet Pfeffer, for any closing remarks.', 'Janet Pfeffer', 'Thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions, and have a good day.', 'Operator']","2015","', 'Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ingersoll-Rand Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

Mike?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Great. Thanks Janet. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution, that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment.', 'Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all time records. Particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the industrial segment, and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to over deliver on our commitments, despite lower than forecasted revenues.', \"Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, that's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19, so adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better [ph] than our guidance midpoint.\", 'Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. About half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. That translates to a couple of cents headwinds versus our earnings guidance. The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending, as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance.', 'Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses, as well as residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency remain strong. Ex-currency, Latin America was down low single digits, with strong results in Mexico, partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency in Asia, revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets.', 'Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, organic revenue and industrial was down 2%. As you will see when I get to the forecast, we adjust our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower industrial markets and currency.', 'Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in transport against record orders in 2014, as well as a slowdown in industrial. Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange were up low single digits and were up mid-single digits in North America.', 'Adjusted operating margins increased one full percentage point, a stronger productivity and pricing combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter, and have completed our announced 250 million of share repurchase in early October.', 'And I will turn it over to Sue, and then I will come back to take you through the fourth quarter outlook.', 'Sue Carter', \"Thanks Mike. Let's go to slide 4 please; orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis, and up 3% excluding currencies, on an organic basis which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency.\", 'Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens. Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American transport and in marine. Organic orders for industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by low single digits in Club Car.', 'Please go to slide 5; just a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis, and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I will give more color on each segment in just a few slides.', 'The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 3%.', \"Let's go to slide 6 please; this chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, of 13% to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix.\", 'Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year, from material deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points, driven by strong productivity and cost containments. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points.', 'That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend control.', \"Let's go to slide 7 please; the climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8%, ex-currency.\", 'Third quarter organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year, and increased by high teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat.', 'The North American residential HVAC market continued in orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens, ex-currency, with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens.', \"Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to productivity and volume/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.\", 'Please go to slide 8; third quarter revenues for the industrial segments were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also 2% organically, as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from parts and service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investment.\", 'Please go to slide 9; for the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some pre-build of inventories prior to ERP system go lives, which went live in October, without event.', 'Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year.', 'Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income targets for cash generation.', 'And with that, I will turn it back to Mike.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Great. Thanks Sue and please go to slide 10; North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There is no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid to high single digit growth for 2015 in North America and commercial HVAC markets.', 'The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the [indiscernible] that occurred in the back part of 2014.', 'To [Indiscernible] North American climate segment markets, we expect North American transport market to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year. North American industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits.', 'We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid single digits at constant currency, from flat to down, after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia has slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year.', 'We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year.', 'Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we are reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said, really $50 million of that happened in the third quarter.', 'Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about four percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about three points for the year. Organic growth, ex-currency and acquisitions remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July.', 'We expect climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change to climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million, and its mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July, and reflects continued weakness in China.', 'For the industrial segment, revenues are now forecast in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis; which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. Its almost all from lower volumes, that short cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment pushouts on larger machines. You might recall, that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in industrial in the second half, the new forecast reflects about 2% contraction in organic growth in the second half and industrial.', 'Within the industrial segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter, and a continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect climate margins to be in the range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margin to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance. This higher productivity and the continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volume.', 'Please go to slide 11; our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year, down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we are entering the fourth quarter with and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken and that will continue. The range for reported or GAAP [indiscernible] EPS is $2.57 to $2.62. Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition.', 'Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela, including these, the reported EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92.', 'We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter and the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast will put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75%, at about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter, and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year.', \"Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning, naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us six years ago. He has been instrumental in our value stream transformation and in the development of the company's first operating system, which is the foundation for the company's birth in operational excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success and strategy implementation makes them highly qualified and serve as the compressed air system and services business President.\", \"Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President of Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our operational excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll-Rand seven years ago, and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the global integrated supply chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the climate solutions and industrial technology sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd.\", 'These changes reflect our commitment to premier performance, aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans.', \"So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a five year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance, will be a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow, with a further implementation of our strategies. We have already taken and will continue to take actions to generate growth and earnings, as needed to respond to market conditions.\", 'And so with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.', 'Nigel Coe', 'Good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Good morning Nigel.', 'Sue Carter', 'Good morning.', 'Nigel Coe', 'So let me start off with the change amendments for the industrial segment. Congratulations to Todd and Keith in their new roles. I am just wondering, what if anything changes in terms of the [indiscernible] for industrial tech, and to [indiscernible] the question Mike, is that -- the margins, the trickle of investor retention [ph] and I am just wondering, is that a recognition, given all the background that perhaps there should be a sharp focus on productivity and cost containment there?', 'Mike Lamach', \"Well looking at the opportunities, Nigel, and we are dead committed to the 70% and 90% operating margins that we have communicated in the past. We want to accelerate that as quickly as possible, and for the segment to achieve that, we have got to achieve that [indiscernible] that business, first and foremost. So the effort here would be certainly on all of the growth and operational excellence activities in the company. We see great opportunity in the value stream work, and reaccelerating that. So its really -- I think, a tribute to Todd's leadership, but also to a commitment to being on-track and getting ourselves on track for that business.\", 'Nigel Coe', 'Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-on there, Mike. The 50 bips of price cost benefit this quarter, consistent with commentary, but I think probably a little bit better than certainly what we expected. As that continues to get better, as the hedges start to roll off on the copper and aluminum, or is this a pretty good run rate from here?', 'Sue Carter', \"Nigel, let's think about the cost or the price and material from a longer term perspective. So what we would have is a -- we'd have a total average spread between direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. What we said when we talked in July, was that in the second half of 2015, we would see wider spreads, because the material deflation was really kicking in, which is exactly what we saw in that 60 bips spread.\", \"But in general, we are still targeting about 30 percentage points of spread for the year, then as we look at, going forward, we'd hang on to that goal of having a positive spread of 20 to 30 basis points. So I don't think that edge moves up forward, at least in the near term, that 2016 commodities are going to increase. We have got about 50% of our copper for 2016 locked in. However, I think its more realistic to think about the overall spread being 20 to 30 basis points, rather than a 60 basis point spread being a normal. I don't think that works [ph].\", 'Nigel Coe', 'Okay, great. Thanks a lot.', 'Mike Lamach', 'I think Nigel, more than we though really, but we kind of thought 50, it was 60. So its pretty close to the number that we had thought.', 'Nigel Coe', 'Okay. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', \"Thank you. Good morning guys and ladies. Just quickly on Cameron and just the M&A impact. Just wanted to check my math, it sounds like you've actually held your Cameron forecast? If I am assuming a 3% acquisition contribution, that would imply about $380 million in revenues and back out [indiscernible], it was like 340-ish for Cameron. It sounds like no change there, but then Mike, you also made a comment about de-risking Cameron a little bit. So can you just reconcile that or am I missing something in that math?\", 'Mike Lamach', 'Jeff, great question. Let me walk through. So I talked about the fact that we reduced the back half for you in total for the company by $140 million. $50 million of that would have happened in Q3, so $90 million relating to Q4. Also [indiscernible], there was regular change to the climate, really the top $30 million, leaving $60 million in the industrial businesses. We think about the Cameron piece of large machines, and we took a $20 million to $25 million view of risk on that, saying that, we know of some instances and perhaps will know some more delays for oftentimes customer acceptance or readiness on those sides. So think about $20 million, $25 million being associated with big machines.', 'The balance of that could be split 50-50 between all of what the short cycle replenishment is in industrial and FX again. So if you look at sort of the Cameron piece of this, on the large machine exposure, 20-25, and then if you look at just short cycle of recovery, some of that would be plant there, for both Ingersoll-Rand legacy and Cameron, it would be the normal smaller plant there. We are not seeing the order rates returning there, we are seeing some slowdown of capital spending from industrial customers in Q3 and Q4, and so there is a bit of that in there as well.', 'Jeffrey Sprague', 'Okay. And then, just shifting gears on TK, orders down on tough comps, but the comps are going to stay tough, right, in North America, in particular in trailer. How do you see things playing out? Should we still be thinking about double digit type decline or more in trailer in North America in 2016?', 'Sue Carter', \"So Jeff, let me give that a shot. So you're right, as we look at the order rates for North America for trailer in the third quarter, they declined. Again, we expected that, we talked about some of those orders being roughly at peak in the second quarter, and it really is a tough compare to 2014. So when we look at the fourth quarter, so first I will take fourth quarter, we expect the trailer orders again to show negative year-over-year comparisons, again, based on really strong 2014, actually record order levels last year.\", \"So what we are looking at is, the tough comparisons on TK in total, orders for the third quarter and overseas markets were actually down, and ex-currency were roughly flat. But you also asked a question about 2016. So if we look at what's out there in terms of ACT data. So we are not telling you about your forecast. So we are looking at ACT data. We still are seeing forecast for that to come down in the ranges of probably some of those double digits. But we are closely assessing the markets, especially in trailer and in looking at the record volume. So not really a precise answer, but the tough comps are really the big part of the story, and in 2016, ACT doesn't see much change from the prior outlooks.\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Jeff, if you took that kind of 15% kind of the -- sort of the market for North American trailer. I recognize, it’s a little bit less than 25% of our business. We are probably going to see pretty good markets in Europe and Middle East. We are seeing probably good markets for marines, rail, bus and for our air, refrigeration businesses that we talked about a scenario last time that, a 10% to 15% decline in North American trailer, is something that we think we could still grow margins, in the TK business, and potentially, actually grow the top line. But that's not to be concluded until we finalize the plan.\", 'Jeffrey Sprague', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.', 'Steven Winoker', 'Thanks and good morning all. Just to clarify that answer for Jeff. On the Cameron deal, you had originally promised $0.8 to $0.10 of gross accretion for 2015. So bottom line like, where is that -- what number it looks like you are going to achieve this year on that?', 'Mike Lamach', 'So cash accretion so at about $0.08 -- maybe a little bit better, but about $0.08.', 'Steven Winoker', \"Okay, great. And then on the restocking impact in resi and destocking across industrial. What are you seeing -- what kind of impact do you think that's having on the business?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well residential is lumpy. You know Steve, it's hard for a quarter-to-quarter compare with all that's happened with the change in [indiscernible] regulations. Our global residential business was up mid-teens, but our North American residential bookings were up high teens. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into the booking numbers, and some of the anomalies from quarter-to-quarter.\", 'The industrial restocking, is just more of an indication of slowing industrial markets, and as a fact that companies like ours are probably pulling in a bit on CapEx and we see our service businesses growing. So one thing you see in a typically mild pull back in your commercial-industrial phase, is that service business should grow. And our service business grew mid-single digits and mid single digits in industrial, which is a pretty good performance.', 'Steven Winoker', 'Okay. And then just following up your point about 30 basis points ongoing prices versus raws, and if I think about same growth rate maybe next year as this year for the overall business, if that were to be the case. Do you think you can hold these kinds of mid-40s organic incrementals?', 'Sue Carter', 'I think if we look at really more along the lines of what we have said longer term, which is -- we are comfortable with looking at incrementals that are -- and our gross margin levels, as opposed to trying to project what happens to all of those. And I understand the comment on deflation and the productivity that we have had, but I think there is going to be some other areas that are going to have even tougher comps in 2016 going forward. So I think, the price spread of 20 to 30 bips and our incremental leverage being at gross margin levels, have probably got a longer term weight of just thinking about the business.', 'Steven Winoker', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.', 'Deane Dray', 'Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping Sue could clarify the comment on expectations for -- did you say inventory increasing in the fourth quarter, and its impact on your free cash flow conversion?', 'Sue Carter', 'Right. So I am hoping that our inventory does not increase in the fourth quarter. What I meant, and hopefully what I said is, right now, our inventory levels are higher than what we would have seen a year ago. Part of that is, because of the build-up of the air compressor inventory for Q4 shipment. Part of that is the pre-build for the ERP go-live and some other impacts from -- actually the revenue decreasing.', \"But what I expect to see in the fourth quarter, is I expect to see the inventory come down, but the comment is that I don't really expect it to get back to the previous levels, or year ago levels at the end of 2015. So we will continue to work all of that off, it doesn't mean it's an issue, it just means its going to be slightly heavier. And what we have done, to answer your question, on a free cash flow basis, is that we did -- our original range was $950 million to $1 billion, we said roughly $950 million at this point in time, and what we are doing from a free cash flow perspective, is that everything that you might expect us to do, which is, we are overdriving performance on receivables. We are looking at all the things that make sense, in terms of being tight on all the other elements of free cash flow to make up for the fact that we have got a little more inventory than what we had a year ago.\", \"So I don't think any of this is an issue. I think our free cash flow, being at 98% and sort of projected net income is running in line with where we'd like it to be. So I don't think it’s a problem, I think its just going to be a little higher than it was a year ago.\", 'Deane Dray', 'Sue, I appreciate the clarity. And Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the European strength in climate. Did that surprise you at all? How much is fix a factor there, and it looks like you could be getting some share gains?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Well it is surprising us for a couple of years in terms of just the success I think we have had. But as I said in the past, we have got an excellent team, bringing new business and a lot of new products and services being launched into the marketplace. So continued good performance there.', 'Deane Dray', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Julian Mitchell', \"Thank you. Just a question on industrial. I think you're guiding for Q4 organically to be down about the same degree in revenues as Q3, so maybe down about 2% year-on-year. But the orders progression has got worse, Q3 versus Q2 and the organic sales hurdle is higher in Q4. So maybe just confirm is that's really the case, and maybe talk a little bit about how you are seeing industrial demand trending kind of within the quarter and in the last couple of months, specifically?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"The [indiscernible] Julian that we have really is in China, which really runs a pretty wide range of worst case, best case. And so, we are taking something out of a more conservative range in China at this point, and that's really the wildcard. The balance of it really is just sort of the book in turn that we know of and conservative views now on restocking into some of the stock businesses.\", 'Sue Carter', \"And I would say Julian, you are right. When we talked in July, we have seen some short cycle markets recover in June. Some, but its not all certainly, and that reacceleration didn't continue in the third quarter, as we had anticipated, and we did lower our industrial growth outlook for the second half from plus 2% to minus 2%. So you are absolutely right.\", 'Julian Mitchell', 'Got it. I guess, you are not expecting the decline to get worse in Q4, even though you have a tougher comp in industrial?', 'Mike Lamach', 'We had a little bit of a surprise favorability in bookings in Latin America in the compressor business, a bit of a surprise. And again, we think, we have taken a conservative view and China team has a roadmap on some larger orders that could close. But I think we have got this tackled with the 90 million in the back half, 60 million of it really being attributed to -- I am sorry, the fourth quarter, $90 million for the company, $60 million in industrial. We think we have got it covered here with what we know today.', 'Julian Mitchell', 'Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on Trane in Asia. I think obviously, the trends, even back in July, were pretty unsteady in China. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you have seen the order intake in the backlog moving there?', 'Sue Carter', \"So let's just kind of talk about china in general. So obviously, economic growth rate, significantly below the historic rates, with the government attempting to rebalance the economy and all of those different pieces. Some of that is not smooth, some of it is lumpy and so some of the comparisons get a little bit volatile, if you just go from quarter-to-quarter. But if we look at HVAC bookings in China for the quarter, they were actually up low single digits versus last year. And for the quarter, HVAC revenues in China -- for the fourth quarter, the HVAC revenues in China are expected to be down low single digits, and part of that is applied systems and the growth there being more than offset by lower unitary revenues and currency. And so, there is a lot of different pieces that are moving around. If we just look at non-residential construction markets start in the fourth quarter last year, some of that continued into the second half of 2015. Some of the areas of strength or verticals, where we do see some growth would be data centers, healthcare, and mix development opportunity.\", 'Mike Lamach', 'Good news there Julian, was the fourth quarter positive bookings and HVAC in China.', 'Julian Mitchell', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', \"Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Hey Shannon.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Mike, so just on the -- to clarify the leverage point in the fourth quarter. I think you said corporate going down $15 million to $60 million. Is there some other maybe offset below the line and other income or anything that we should be aware of? It just seems like, I end up a little high, if corporate goes down $15 million?', 'Sue Carter', \"Well so when you think about the fourth quarter leverage and the different pieces, in the spot where you are going to look at and what's happening, if organic growth is going to be in the range of 2% to 3%, so you have got $75 million to $80 million of revenue. If you have got productivity and direct material inflation, we are still continuing to get price, and if those are the primary drivers of productivity in the fourth quarter, and you have lower corporate. To your point, the math does work out to be in the 75% to 80% range for the fourth quarter.\", 'Mike Lamach', 'Shannon, another way to look at it, $75 million of revenue at the midpoint, $40 million NOI on that, take $15 million off that for corporate, now you are talking about nearly $25 million on $75 million. You have got 33% leverage and look at the price deflation spread, look at the productivity of our other inflation spread, and its really a doable number.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Okay. And there is nothing -- I know your other line moves around, there is nothing different going on there. It has been bouncing all over the place, something I had to model, [indiscernible] currency, but do you have anything moving significantly down the other line?', 'Sue Carter', 'No. So the fourth quarter should be relatively flat. So not really a lot of movement there that we are looking at.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Just on the commercial HVAC bookings, up mid-single digits in the Americas, do you have sort of the North America split of that? I think you used to give, and is there any parts of North America you see getting better or worse?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Applied is trending, as we said, applied, mid single, its sort of the institutional piece of that large unitary that applied to institutional is -- in fact, the larger unitary is doing really well. The open backlog [ph] sort of matches what the booking trends looks like, which gives us some sense that -- to think about open quote [ph] got predating bookings by three to six months. The rates stay fairly consistent going into 2016. So I think that its shaping up like the though, which is this mid-single digit institutional recovery that should last a few years. That state is still quite a bit more aggressive, and that you are showing institutional put in place 2016 versus 2015, 14%, starts at 10%. But I think as you all know, historically been fairly high, it comes down throughout the year.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan\", 'Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.', 'Steve Tusa', \"Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Shannon's question. Can you just kind of give us the approximate margins? There are some rounding dynamics here, and you guys got some squiggly lines next to the numbers annually, and so I am just having a little bit of trouble again getting kind of low enough for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us more rough approximation of what the 4Q is for the segments? Margin-wise?\", 'Sue Carter', 'So if we are looking at the total year for industrial being in the range of 13% or roughly 14%. So you are right, we have got a little bit of a squiggle in there. What that would imply for the fourth quarter on industrial, is margins in sort of the 15.5-ish type of range. And part of that gets driven by the compressor shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as continued productivity and lower inflationary type environment.', 'Steve Tusa', 'Okay. And then for climate, I think we are backing it into something around 13.5%? Is that about right?', 'Sue Carter', 'So climate, with the sort of 13 that we are looking at for the full year, would be -- if you backed into a -- that climate midpoint would be just a smidge under the 13 range for the fourth quarter?', 'Steve Tusa', \"Okay. Then that makes more sense. And last question, just on the resi dynamics, what will mix contribute this year? I don't think you guys had great mix in the second quarter, like maybe some others did? There maybe different timing dynamics around how much 14-SEER you are now selling? How much of that 14-SEER transition is booked this year, and then how much is kind of still yet to come for next year?\", 'Mike Lamach', 'We have some negative mix, Steve, in the year with 14-SEER, which works itself out this year. But we think that generally 14 is accretive [ph] to 13 and we are seeing really good margin expansion in the res business. So in spite of the mix down of 14 for us, good absorption, good expansion, and work itself through in 2015.', 'Steve Tusa', 'And then for 2016, is there still some benefit to come in [ph]?', 'Mike Lamach', \"I think there is better -- I don't think have got the issue of mixing down in 2016. I mean, there could be a quarter, four or five months that -- you have to take with -- these dynamics of the change this year, in terms of stocking 13-SEER. For the most part, I think we should be having a pretty clean year, next year, in terms of mix.\", 'Steve Tusa', 'Okay, great. Thanks.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.', 'Robert McCarthy', 'Good morning everyone. I guess the first question I would have, is just, taking into account some of the comments around state of the U.S. non-resi and the limited visibility on the industrial side. I mean, how do you think about directionally about 2016 in terms of EPS growth, and what can you provide in addition, maybe for CapEx or -- you have provided some incremental margins. So what can you provide about 2016, how we should be thinking about it?', 'Mike Lamach', 'I mean, first of all, remember, we will do it from February, so I will give just some general sense of where things are going. But before I do that, step back for a minute and we look at 75% of the companies being in the climate segment. Of that, really 60% of the company is HVAC and more than 60% of that is in North America. So you have got, really 40% of the company, with pretty strong growth dynamics going into 2016.', 'I think HVAC in Europe, Eastern Europe, even potentially the Middle East will be growth organically for us, probably not the same rate of course as North America. But you have got that growing. So in essence, a large part of the business is growing for us.', 'When you think about industrial; I think that Asia, Latin America, continue to be a bit of a struggle and maybe some currency headwind coming at us. But net-net, we see that even with low growth next year, we will expand margins nicely. I am not going to give you an EPS number today, but we certainly feel like there is an opportunity with the pockets we are seeing at growth in 2015 [indiscernible].', 'Robert McCarthy', 'Okay. And then just one follow-up; in terms of just capital allocation and then just reinvestment in the business, given the prevailing environment. Certain change or nuance of the margin in terms of M&A or other forms of capital redeployment or internal reinvestment?', 'Sue Carter', 'No. When we look at it, we expect to continue the balance capital allocation that we have got. We have investment in our businesses. We can expect continue having a strong dividend payout. So in the 30% to 35% range, we will continue to, at a minimum, offset dilution with share repurchase activities. And then, the remainder of it, we will basically continue to toggle between value accretive M&A and additional share repurchase and just evaluate what makes the most sense at any given point in time.', \"Now, you had also asked about CapEx, and so generally speaking, our CapEx is usually in the range of about $250 million, which is roughly equal to depreciation, and we don't expect that to change going forward either.\", 'Mike Lamach', 'The CapEx and investments are a number, that Robert, we can work with during the -- depending on what we see in terms of the environment. There is some flexibility for us to spend less, if we need to -- to help us on the EPS commitments that we will make.', 'Robert McCarthy', 'Thanks for your time.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.', 'Josh Pokrzywinski', 'Hi good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Hey Josh.', 'Josh Pokrzywinski', 'Just a couple of questions, first on Cameron; obviously backlog is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, but can you give us maybe an indication on how order trends and visibility or coverage into next year looks, maybe versus what normal seasonality should look like? They are obviously [indiscernible] to the year yet, but just kind of any color on orders would be helpful?', 'Sue Carter', \"Sure Josh. One of the interesting things about the history and what happened in that engineered compressor business, is that not only are shipments back half loaded, but generally, orders in the launch engineered compressors are also back half loaded. So we are seeing real time, what's happening in the different places in the market. So let me give you a little color on what I think we are seeing, and how that translates into what we see for 2016.\", 'So in general, you are going to look at this space being negatively impacted by all of the oil and gas majors are going to put [ph] in capital, 20% to 30%. There is industry consolidation. EPC activity is slowed, and so when you think about projects, there is probably, in general, fewer projects. Same number of competitors, which means that you need to be really sharp, you need to be really focused, and really work at the orders.', \"Now, having said that, if I break down the different pieces of the business. So on processed gas, which is roughly a quarter of the business; there is still some growth from the natural gas side of things, and LNG. There are some Middle East project delays. However, you have got petrochemical doing okay. Power-gen, particularly in Europe being an area where, there are some projects and things that we can look at, and so, when we think about the processed gas, one of the things that you can start to think about, is on the chemical side or petrochemicals, is the lower gas price, give you a lower feedstock price and that could change some of those dynamics. I don't know.\", \"But its still a tough environment, as I said fewer projects and some things happening. Engineer, air, so another quarter of the business, you have still got air separation, particularly in the China market, that to be honest, I don't see changing any time soon. There is going to be some activity, but there is going to be a lot lower activity, and if you looked in just, what's happening from, industrial gas businesses and activity, you'd see lower activity in the first half versus 2014 and 2015, and I am not sure that that changes. And again, that industry, looking at projects where we might take place with some of that engineered air product, with air separation, you have got over capacity, lower steel demand and all of that.\", 'In plant there, which is -- we can turn pieces of business. Its roughly flat versus 2014. There are still some good markets out there, with auto, food and beverage. Europe is a little slower on that side and Asia is down, and then the aftermarket for the business is where opportunity still exists. And so in general, you have got softer markets, still some projects moving forward. But we are in the period, when a lot of the orders take place. So we have got our eye on what happens in 2016 with all the different pieces.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Synergy-wise too Josh, we are really on track with -- as an example, just sort of the plant there, the rent synergies and the cost synergies, and if anything over the last few months, we have gotten a sort of even more conviction around the opportunity for the engineering, supply chain and manufacturing synergies that could exist in the business.', 'So I think that we will continue to make the business accretive and in 2016, we will make sure that if we got the weakness. [Indiscernible] who is talking about, that we have got a response to keep the margins at or better than when they were this year. And we got a roadmap to do that.', 'Sue Carter', 'And I think the bottom line of all of that is, its still a great business and its still a great product for us. And like I said, in spite of all of the things that I said about the market, its accretive in 2015, and we are getting the synergies. So more to come on this one.', 'Josh Pokrzywinski', \"That's great detail. And if I could just ask a follow-up on TK, I have heard that some of the trailer guys have opened up the order books, maybe a month or so early than they normally would for the following year. Is that something you guys have seen, and is any of the strength in North America this quarter, and maybe a month or so [indiscernible] had from what you might normally have seasonally?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well, clearly [indiscernible] which customers opened up their order books and whose customers they are. So you could take the top 10 customers, they are going to order at different points in time. But I would say that, in the third quarter, you had some customers that open up their order books, and we have seen the same thing happen in the past, where there is a little bit of an anomaly between who is ordering. So we are -- whose order and who is left to order, and I don't think you're seeing a lot of dynamic shift in that. But you will see differences in book rates and revenue rates depending on when that occurs. Some of these guys will buy 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 units, and so it makes a difference when you are looking at 6,000 to 8,000 unit month, which we is what we have been saying the last few months.\", 'Josh Pokrzywinski', 'Got you. All right. Appreciate. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.', 'Andrew Obin', 'Yeah, good morning guys.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Good morning Andrew.', 'Andrew Obin', 'Nice quarter in this doom and gloom environment. Just a question; there was some debate inside the company about how to look at the value stream process, and at the Analyst Day, you have indicated that you are reassessing your approach, because you have sort of touched a lot of low hanging fruit. And then, we seemed to have had a pause in execution last quarter and this quarter operating leverage just seemed to have come through very nicely. Can you describe to us what internal operating changes you have been implementing over the past six months to address this next level of operating improvement.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Yeah, a lot Andrew. I am not sure I will cover it here, it would be a great discussion that we could have when we get together for our review this spring, in general. But we have used this product growth team as a basis to expand the effort across the company. We have continued to now touch really all of the business with the value streams. Sourcing has become, I think, mature across the company. We have got really good productivity last three quarters, really in general. If you look past Q2 and kind of look at the last three quarters, we are seeing productivity accelerate.', \"Its never really that linear. I know we'd all like for it to be, but its not. We have projects and ideas that, at a certain point in time, kick in a quarter, and those make a difference. Higher volumes would make even a more positive difference of course. So we are doing this all with actually quite sort of low volumes than some of our businesses. So we are excited, as volumes do return, we'd see even better productivity and the change that we have made.\", \"And so, look, I think that we haven't really changed the operating system in five years, we have just really looked across as product growth teams, and now have touched most or all the companies in one way shape or form.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'And just a follow-up question, I apologize if you have answered it already. But can you comment on cadence of industrial orders throughout the quarter?', 'Mike Lamach', \"Cadence throughout the quarter, there really weren't any sort of high spots in the quarter to say. They were choppy, they were just sort of low in the entire quarter. We had pretty good growth in our fleet management business, obviously which was a highlight for us. It was kind of a double digit grower there, it's a good sign. But material handling, which is really our only oil exposed business, significant declines of 50% in bookings in that business from prior year. So inside industrial, when you move the compressor business out of the way and you look at some of the smaller businesses, there are some high and low points, that generally speaking, pretty explainable if you look at material handling as a good example of that.\", 'Andrew Obin', 'Terrific. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.', 'Joe Ritchie', 'Thanks and good morning.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Hi Joe.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"So a quick clarification. Mike, you mentioned earlier the dodge [ph] data on the institutional side, and your expectations for next year. But there is not a lot of noise in the data, especially on the commercial side. I am just curious, what if anything you're seeing and what you're making of that noise on the unitary side of your business?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well, I think that the large unitary business continues to do well, because, there is also a lot of large unitary that's split into more of the institutional environment. So that continues.\", 'Actually the commercial activity has been fairly strong. If you split up commercial-industrial, industrial has probably been just a little bit weaker in North America. But not a bad environment frankly at all for us. So we continue to think it’s a pretty good North American market, for both institutional and industrial. But in terms of strength going forward, its really institutional than commercial, and then industrial HVAC kind of trending in that direction.', 'Joe Ritchie', \"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe following up on that, how do you think about mix then, as you head into next year? Clearly, we talked a little bit about some North America headwinds on TK. But some of the mix headwinds on resi sits aside. How are you guys thinking about mix? Particularly, in light of the climate margin target of 13% to 14% for 2016?\", 'Mike Lamach', \"Well I mean, on track in a nutshell, Joe. I mean, TK still gives us really good volumes from a profitability perspective, working with pretty high volumes across the board. Even though the year-over-year decrease in the market will be there, we have got plenty of gas left there and grow parts of the business that we didn't have last time around. So we feel pretty good about being able to hold their head up on the TK business. As you look at a climate, great expansion in margins, in the res business. I have said before, I will say again, mid-teens, mid-teens plus EBITDA. The commercial business, particularly in Europe is doing well, and we are hitting some critical mass there, and I think we will begin to contribute more to that margins across the business.\", 'And then in general, North America just does a really good job in terms of share and consistent margin expansion there. So feel pretty good about that. The wildcards are really Latin America and Asia for us, as it relates to HVAC businesses.', \"And here, we talk about pricing in China, but its not sort of an environment that's impossible, its just more difficult for us. So we are persevering in China, and again, we feel good at least about the quarter, bookings going in the right direction. We'd love to see next couple of quarters, look the same way before we feel more constructive about China -- about Asia in general.\", 'Joe Ritchie', 'Okay, thanks. I will get back in queue.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Janet Pfeffer, for any closing remarks.', 'Janet Pfeffer', 'Thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions, and have a good day.', 'Operator']","', 'Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ingersoll-Rand Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].', \"I would now like to hand the call over to Janet Pfeffer. Ma'am, you may begin.\", 'Janet Pfeffer', \"Thank you, Tricia. Good morning and welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's third quarter 2015 conference call. We released earnings at 6:30 this morning, and the release is posted on our web site. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this call through our web site at ingersollrand.com, where you'll also find the slide presentation that we'll be using.\", \"If you would, please go to slide 2, our Safe Harbor statement. Statements made on today's call that are not historic facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables which were attached to our news release this morning.\", 'With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Mike?', 'Mike Lamach', 'Great. Thanks Janet. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution, that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment.', 'Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all time records. Particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the industrial segment, and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to over deliver on our commitments, despite lower than forecasted revenues.', \"Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, that's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19, so adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better [ph] than our guidance midpoint.\", 'Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. About half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. That translates to a couple of cents headwinds versus our earnings guidance. The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending, as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance.', 'Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses, as well as residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency remain strong. Ex-currency, Latin America was down low single digits, with strong results in Mexico, partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency in Asia, revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets.', 'Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, organic revenue and industrial was down 2%. As you will see when I get to the forecast, we adjust our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower industrial markets and currency.', 'Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in transport against record orders in 2014, as well as a slowdown in industrial. Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange were up low single digits and were up mid-single digits in North America.', 'Adjusted operating margins increased one full percentage point, a stronger productivity and pricing combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter, and have completed our announced 250 million of share repurchase in early October.', 'And I will turn it over to Sue, and then I will come back to take you through the fourth quarter outlook.', 'Sue Carter', \"Thanks Mike. Let's go to slide 4 please; orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis, and up 3% excluding currencies, on an organic basis which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency.\", 'Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens. Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American transport and in marine. Organic orders for industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by low single digits in Club Car.', 'Please go to slide 5; just a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis, and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I will give more color on each segment in just a few slides.', 'The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 3%.', \"Let's go to slide 6 please; this chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, of 13% to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix.\", 'Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year, from material deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points, driven by strong productivity and cost containments. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points.', 'That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend control.', \"Let's go to slide 7 please; the climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8%, ex-currency.\", 'Third quarter organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year, and increased by high teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat.', 'The North American residential HVAC market continued in orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens, ex-currency, with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens.', \"Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to productivity and volume/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.\", 'Please go to slide 8; third quarter revenues for the industrial segments were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also 2% organically, as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from parts and service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investment.\", 'Please go to slide 9; for the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some pre-build of inventories prior to ERP system go lives, which went live in October, without event.', 'Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year.', 'Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income targets for cash generation.', 'And with that, I will turn it back to Mike.', 'Mike Lamach', 'Great. Thanks Sue and please go to slide 10; North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There is no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid to high single digit growth for 2015 in North America and commercial HVAC markets.', 'The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the [indiscernible] that occurred in the back part of 2014.', 'To [Indiscernible] North American climate segment markets, we expect North American transport market to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year. North American industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits.', 'We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid single digits at constant currency, from flat to down, after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia has slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year.', 'We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year.', 'Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we are reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said, really $50 million of that happened in the third quarter.', 'Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about four percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about three points for the year. Organic growth, ex-currency and acquisitions remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July.', 'We expect climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change to climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million, and its mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July, and reflects continued weakness in China.', 'For the industrial segment, revenues are now forecast in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis; which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. Its almost all from lower volumes, that short cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment pushouts on larger machines. You might recall, that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in industrial in the second half, the new forecast reflects about 2% contraction in organic growth in the second half and industrial.', 'Within the industrial segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter, and a continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect climate margins to be in the range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margin to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance. This higher productivity and the continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volume.', 'Please go to slide 11; our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year, down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we are entering the fourth quarter with and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken and that will continue. The range for reported or GAAP [indiscernible] EPS is $2.57 to $2.62. Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition.', 'Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela, including these, the reported EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92.', 'We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter and the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast will put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75%, at about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter, and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year.', \"Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning, naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us six years ago. He has been instrumental in our value stream transformation and in the development of the company's first operating system, which is the foundation for the company's birth in operational excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success and strategy implementation makes them highly qualified and serve as the compressed air system and services business President.\", \"Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President of Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our operational excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll-Rand seven years ago, and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the global integrated supply chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the climate solutions and industrial technology sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd.\", 'These changes reflect our commitment to premier performance, aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans.', \"So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a five year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance, will be a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow, with a further implementation of our strategies.

This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress in the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions.\", 'Starting with full year 2015, it was a year that I can characterize best by one word and that word is volatility; volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market.', 'During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each of it ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headline results were essentially right on the forecast we gave you a year ago.', 'The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74; our actual is $3.73. That performance was with significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind for currency in guidance, it ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million.', \"We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control while doing our best to anticipate the things we couldn't control and we made adjustments accordingly.\", '2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multi-year strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, mature and key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets.', \"We have consistently delivered on our commitments even in volatile times, and we hope that you'd agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost five years ago, we've met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions.\", 'For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes FX and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low-single digits.', 'Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. In a fairly diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015.', 'We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points.', \"We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend with a 16% increase in 2015 and we announced an additional 10% increase of dividend last week.\", 'We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015. And more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011.', 'In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussman, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016.', 'Please go to slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. As shown here, the last five years, our operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011 despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During the same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%.', 'Please go to slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015 which was 11%. This chart is shown on a reported basis, so it includes restructuring and inventory step-up costs which are excluded from adjusted margins.', 'We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had a 20 basis point impact of inventory step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%.', 'The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics, and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our lean operating system and overhead costs discipline, together outpacing other inflation. Foreign exchange was a drag to margins of 50 basis points.', 'We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems, and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business. Those collectively were a 30 basis point investment year-over-year.', \"Now, Sue will take you to through the fourth quarter, and then I'll come back to you through 2016's outlook.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide 6. At the summary level, our organic bookings for the quarter were up 2% and organic revenues were up 3%. Residential and Commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus-percent.', \"Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year.

But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.', 'For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value accretive acquisitions and share repurchases based upon relative valuation and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders.', \"For the ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive.\", \"And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance.\", 'Michael W.

Transport markets in the Americas will be flat to down as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products.

The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1% excluding foreign exchange.

And our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Hey, guys. Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Steve.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Just a couple of questions. On the first quarter dynamics, you have a decent organic growth rate but it doesn't look like there's much contribution from operations on EPS. What's going on there?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"So, Steve, good morning, first of all. As we start to look at the first quarter bridge that you can actually see in the slides, what we're looking at is we've got restructuring costs that are in the first quarter. Our operating results are really going to be in the range of – and this includes the restructuring – negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year.\", \"So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so, I think the first quarter is just going to be a tough compares and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. So in Industrial, that makes a bit of a sense. On this gain you guys are going to take, Mike, given the environment has clearly gotten worse over the course of the last year, you guys are doing some degree of restructuring, and you don't typically do this over time like other companies, but any thoughts to maybe using this gain to perhaps take a bigger swipe at things and get out in front of some restructuring that you may have planned for a couple of years into the future, just to kind of solidify that ability to kind of execute and deliver, like you've been doing over the last year? Is there a bigger restructuring out there, I guess, a potential for that?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, I think, Steve, when you go back to 2009, we've been really consistent about particularly the factory footprint, and that's at a place right now where I think it's very productive, it's well utilized. And when we looked at ideas around us coming into 2016, paybacks were in the range of, say, five years to eight years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable.\", \"That being said, when you look at areas of the business particularly around Compression Technologies, there is restructuring taking place there. And largely, it's in the areas of head count and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So, tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So, there is a sort of drumbeat over time of doing that, but it's an effective and efficient – relatively effective and efficient footprint.\", \"One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten at lean, the further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder it is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain I think open-minded, Steve. If in fact things deteriorated further, if in fact we saw an opportunity, we certainly would look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we've made internally inside the company to this point.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Okay, great. Thanks a lot.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Yeah, thanks. Good morning. First of all, congratulations on a great second half. The execution is certainly a lot better than many of your so-called high-quality peers. So, well done on 3Q, 4Q.', \"I just wondered if I could maybe pick up on Steve's point about – very clear answer on restructuring, but I guess the two areas that pushed back for 2016 plan would be flat Industrial and maybe flat TK. So, I'm wondering if those come in weaker through the year, to what extent do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate the deleverage that you'd see if those do come in weaker.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yes, Nigel, listen, again, I'll pick it up from the point of Steve, this is where investments would be metered down. A lot of investments we're making are not only in product but in channel, and also letting attrition at times work for you. So, we will continue to work that down.\", \"We certainly have a plan to sustain a lower revenue outlook if we see that. It's baked within the guidance we've provided – the range that we've provided. And our focus really is on the Industrial segment and it's fundamentally on the Compression Technologies piece. Todd's all over it. He's well into several months now into the role. I think he's got his eyes wide open around the opportunities. He's optimistic around what he's doing and I've got confidence in Todd and the team that they've got the plans hardwired for lots of different scenarios at this point.\", 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Okay. Well, I'll pick up offline. And secondly, obviously you'd be aware that there's a pretty fertile debate about non-resi in North America given the broader weakness in industrial complex. The high-single digit growth in bookings during the quarter suggests that you're still seeing relatively fertile end markets. But maybe just pick up on where you stand and perhaps maybe comment on how the front is looking (30:43) right now.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, I think the surprise in the fourth quarter, at least to me, was the strength that we had both in applied and unitary in North America. We had double-digit applied bookings in the fourth quarter and we had mid-teens booking in unitary in the fourth quarter. So as a backdrop going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that.\", \"Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high-single-digit growth in services. And controls was up nearly double digits there. So, it feels like we've caught a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully, that's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills into K-to-12 as well. So, that continues.\", \"And then, as you'd expect, just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So, it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year.\", 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, Mike.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Nigel.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Thank you. Just a question around the Climate margin guidance. It looks like you're guiding for a 40%-plus incremental margin in Climate for 2016 overall. Maybe looking at slide 15, you might have some mix headwinds in that segment this year with Resi growing so strongly, Thermo King and Trane Asia being flat to down. So I just wondered what you're embedding for mix in Climate for the year ahead.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"So, Julian, as we think about where Climate is going to go in 2016, I think you're right. You hit some of the high points. So we still see the continued trends in what we talked about in terms of Commercial HVAC in the Americas being strong, in EMEA being up, but on the Asia side being down a little bit. We called Residential up mid-single digits. You also have the factors of Latin America as part of the business. And while you have some growth in those sides, you've also got the transport revenues being flat in 2016.\", \"So I think it's all of those mix pieces could strengthen on the commercial side in North America and Europe, a little down on the Asia side, flat Transport, down on Latin America and good mid-single digit growth in Res.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Okay. So mix is sort of broadly neutral then, 2016 versus 2015 in Climate?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Julian, Residential, if you look at the peer group, we're right at the top of the pack in terms of profitability. I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement that we've had at Residential business. So good Residential growth is good for us. It's fine.\", \"On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs, we had good growth for the year, we had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3 to 1 ratio; if we sell three APUs, that's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I'd point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely and, as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful than North American trailer. So net-net, we're good.\", \"Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft, the market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. Price/material was a 30 bps tailwind for the quarter and the year in 2015. Are you assuming sort of similar-ish for the year ahead?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"We are. Again, you're absolutely right with we ended the fourth quarter with 30 basis points and full year 2015 at 30 basis points to 40 basis points. For 2016, we're going to expect a 30 basis point to 40 basis point range for that gap or that spread between price and direct material inflation. You do have higher material deflation numbers. As you'll recall, we had inflation in the first and second quarters of 2015, so you do get a lift out of that. But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all-in-all it's going to come back to about that same 30 basis point to 40 basis point range in 2016 is what we saw.\", \"One of the other points, and you didn't ask this but I think it's relevant when we're having this discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some and there still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to compare year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Very helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"Hi. Good morning. A couple quick questions. First, acquisition pipeline. Can you give us a little feel for where you're feeling the opportunities are presenting themselves most, be it geographic, end market, however you want to address the question?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Really, David, the strategy for us has been to look at all the SBU's core businesses across all markets. And so there's a pipeline that would reflect all that from that perspective.\", \"There are two fundamental areas that we see for investment. One is channel. We continue to see opportunities, whether it's geographically outside the U.S. for channel or even in the U.S. in terms of buying back commercial distribution. That's a continued emphasis for us.\", \"We also find that when we can take a product, it might be a technology that we don't have, and sell it through our existing channel, particularly on the Trane Commercial side, we do very, very well with that. So obviously it's more attractive if you're buying anything that's (38:21) outside the U.S. And so we're pretty active looking outside the U.S. for a lot of that, which can be then modified and brought into the U.S. with different power requirements and different efficiency ratings, but some of the technologies can be applied. So we're seeing an active pipeline there as well.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'And given the balance sheet power and the cash flow, would you care to give us any sense of bigger than a breadbasket-type sizing of what kind of size deals are you looking at currently?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, probably, David, truthfully that would only get us into trouble I think by doing a big breadbasket estimates. I think that you can look at where we would end the year in terms of ratios. In terms of EBITDA to debt, we end the year around the 2.4 times range. There's obviously some capacity with some of the current debt rating. We've got the cash. We talked about in the call the $675 million that's unidentified. So, there is an opportunity to do something a little bit larger. But what we're generally seeing though are small- to mid-sized deals that just make great economic sense.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'Okay. A couple of quick things. Tax rate, with the IRS settlement now behind us, can you give us some guidance on how you think about the tax rate, be it this year, next year? I saw the tax rate guidance. I must admit, I was looking for a little lower tax rate in 2016 given the IRS settlement. But can you give us some guidelines how to model the next few years?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Sure. So, we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016. I think that when you think about the IRS settlement, what the IRS settlement really does is it takes the risk profile off the company and it puts to bed all of the issues around intercompany debt and any issues that would have been in the 2001, 2002 through 2011 range. But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate.\", \"So, what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now, having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity. And we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at.\", \"So, we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be.\", 'But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rate. And that is, when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate.', \"So, that's a long way around saying we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"All right. So in speaking quickly on cushions, just making sure, the corporate expense – I know there's rounding and you have to give ranges on segments and so forth, but it does seem to be implying your corporate expense goes up 10%, $230 million versus $210 million last year. Is that a rounding issue or should we really think that corporate expense is going up that much? But if you back from a total EBIT sort of implied by the segments, it is a larger number than I would have assumed.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Well, so it's not really rounding, but as we look at corporate expenses and – so, if you think back at 2015, where we started the year with our guidance was about $235 million, may sound familiar, and we ended the year at $210 million on the corporate side.\", 'When we look at 2016, we took a lot of discretionary spend out of 2015. There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cyber security. And we also have on the corporate side. So, we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll-Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in the elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016.', \"So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is and in looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets. So, it's a long way of saying that the $230 million, $235 million range is a lot more normal than $210 million but we're going to watch it closely and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the money is spent very well and to the level that we need to.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"David, if you take the run rate plus the pension, you're right, there was a little bit of gap there which we would normally apply to things like IT infrastructure and security that we're on a program too to refresh. But, look, if the markets turn down, we would just look to pull back from a discretionary standpoint in other areas in corporate. So, there's a little bit of flex in it that we would take if the markets are a little bit rougher than we think.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.', 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Thanks and good morning, all.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Steve.', 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', \"Hey, Mike. You've often talked about one of the characteristics, distinguishing marks, of the new Ingersoll-Rand it's how you hold decrementals when volumes are in the down part of the cycle. So, we're obviously witnessing that inside of Industrial, or about to.\", \"Can you maybe talk about what decrementals you really think you're going to be able to achieve here if things do go a little bit further south? And what's giving you the confidence on just, I guess, down low-single digits in air and industrial products when it looks like bookings are a bit worse than that and the broader environment is also a bit worse?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, Steve, look, a great of example of that was what happened within Compression Technologies. If you take the legacy business, it ran almost flat on much lower volume. So, a great example of that. That was a extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops out on productivity and discretionary spending and really to win in the marketplace.', \"It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition. Typically, it's denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and service side of the business. So, that's a great example.\", \"I would say that where we try to leverage it in the gross range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range but not to exceed 25% to 30%. So, that would be sort of the essence of that. It's going to depend a bit on the business.\", \"I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think, it doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think, largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so, we're really turning on and off sort of factory production and we got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So, a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"And, Steve, just to add on to what Mike said on the Industrial side, when I step back and think about Industrial, I kind of think about three big buckets that impacted that. Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So, over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So, you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron. Again, took that on. You knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015.\", \"And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works, the air business gets the benefit out of some of that but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so, when you say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization, so I'd think about that in the total inflation, too.\", 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Okay, thanks. And then, as a follow-up to an earlier question. You talked a lot about the price versus material deflation rage, spread, but a little more on the pricing environment itself absent material, what are you seeing in your big businesses in pricing, what kind of behavior are you seeing?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, both businesses in the fourth quarter are positive-priced, which is pretty outstanding, frankly, across-the-board, and that's with pressure in Climate in Asia and of course with Industrial pressure all over the world, still able to get price in that business. So, we're still seeing positive price albeit it's pretty thin in the quarter. So that's, I think, a good indicator of sort of pricing power and just sort of the pricing structure within the industry holds pretty well through tougher times.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'And that same will hold for 2016, with both segments projecting positive price for 2016.', 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Okay, thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Jeff.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Hey. Just back to Industrial for a moment, Mike. Just thinking about the margins sequentially, if Cameron hit its targets and with the sequential revenue that you just had seasonally, I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit better there.', 'Can you just kind of walk us through that? And then, just help reconcile this a little bit, how we get comfortable with the kind of flattish Industrial for the year coming off this Q4 order number? Is there something in particular that you see in the pipeline that gives you some confidence in that number?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Jeff, I'll start and then I'll let Sue finish. But what I think a lot of folks don't recognize when we talk about Industrial is impact that material handling and tools would have. Material handling is really exclusively oil and gas for us. It's 7% (50:34) of that segment has been hit incredibly hard. And, frankly, the tools business was hit very hard by that business as well.\", \"Highest-margin businesses in the portfolio. And so when those go down, you feel it. It's a substantial headwind buried inside the segment numbers that's independent of what's happening with Cameron or Compression in general.\", \"The other thing, if you go back to Compression Technologies specifically is we do very well from a margin perspective historically in Asia and in Latin America. And so from a mix perspective, when those markets are down, and they've been absolutely clobbered, we feel that as well from a mix perspective.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Right. And so, let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so, I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that that roadmap, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components.\", 'So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the four components of the business with the plant, air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial markets, and so that book and turn business definitely took a downturn in 2015.', \"You also have tough markets with oil prices. So on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you got fewer projects. You've got the same number of competitors, and so you've got some tough markets there. Then, you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity.\", \"Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies – not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business. And we're going to continue to do that.\", \"So, the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago. But I think as we look to the business and what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Jeff, too, lots maybe in this is really strong execution here by the team integrating it. It'll turn out that the synergy in this thing will be about 15% of Cameron's revenues. So, that's double the synergies we thought we would have, which is a good thing because, obviously, the top line is much weaker and that's the reason it's still accretive from cash EPS perspective in the year.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', \"Just one housekeeping item. The release says there's $250 million of repo in Q4 and $250 million in January. That $250 million in Q4 is really referring to a full year number, correct? Was there some settlement issue or something else that I'm missing there? It looks like you did $233 million through nine months.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'I think that was in October and we had some settlements in September. So there...', 'Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations', 'Late October, we said we had spent I think $233 million and $250 million by the end of October, yes.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Did you catch that?', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Not completely, no.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Okay, sorry. We were joining in on the response in the room and I apologize for that. So we did do the $250 million in the fourth quarter. We talked about that roughly in the third quarter call. And then we had a separate 10b5-1 program that repurchased $250 million in January.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Right.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', '$250 million quarter four, $250 million quarter one.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', \"All right. I'll follow up. It says $233 million in the Q3 10-Q. That's why I'm confused. But I'll follow up.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"That's right. So, yeah. So what happened there, Jeff, so you're absolutely right. At the time we released earnings for the third quarter, which would have been the third week in October, we had not settled out the entire $250 million. So there was a little bit of leakage that was over into the remainder, but it was an October event.\", \"So in other words, we were announcing that we had gone into the market just like we are now. We're not talking about the first quarter, but in the first quarter we repurchased the $250 million, we had repurchased $233 million in October and the total was $250 million for the fourth quarter.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.', 'Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC', \"Thank you and good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to Residential HVAC, I was hoping you'd give a little more commentary on the mix of new buying versus repair. Have you seen any change in behavior there and I guess any margin implication this might have?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, clearly we're seeing more that's not so much new construction and repair, it's largely new construction and replacement. And so we're moving back now towards replacement. Replacement is a very good place for us. We've got really good shares there as compared to new construction where shares are lower. So when the market moves toward replacement, we generally do much better and you saw that in the high-teens bookings in the fourth quarter and the overall good performance that we had in 2015, where we had really excellent performance in 2015.\", 'Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC', 'Okay, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on China just by segment and then also you touched on VRF trends.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, China, it's still rough. We're not seeing great progress in China in either business. Having said that, we're somewhat in a trough and we didn't see it really dip further in the quarter in quarter four. We saw great strength outside of China, so Singapore, Thailand, India, really sort of...\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Hong Kong.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', '...Hong Kong, kind of made the day for us relative to Asia. So, nice to see those markets finally recovering on that front.', \"VRF continues to do very well for us, continues to grow at or above the pace of our unitary business. And we continue to have a very high share in North America, parts of South America in the VRF business. And I think, as you know, we don't play a big role outside of those territories, we play a small role in China largely in commercial VRF or in hybrid systems.\", 'Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC', 'Okay. Thank you. That was it.', 'Operator', \"Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Shannon.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", \"Hey. Mike, in terms of the acquisitions and the currency impact on Industrial this year, I think it seems like every quarter they've been almost 200 basis points. Maybe Sue could provide us the split of what that was for 2015. How much was the acquisition impact, how much was currency? And then next year I'm assuming the acquisition impact year-over-year goes away but you still have some currency. Maybe help us on how those headwinds change.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"It's split about 50/50 in 2015. It was about 1 point both. So, translational and transactional would have been about 1 point and acquisitions would have been about 1 point of headwind.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'And for 2016?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"No acquisition headwind because everything based on the calendar, it was all a 2015 start and finish. So there's nothing there. On the FX side, it's going to be, again, a pretty tough row to hoe, probably 4 points of headwind coming into revenues and we'd see normal leverage against that. So it's probably 30 basis points, 40 basis points coming at us on that front.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Okay.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'And to your question on the full year of 2015, so the overall operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the math would work out roughly the same if you took out the foreign exchange and the acquisitions, that that would be the majority of what the decrement was in the overall operating margin percentage.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Okay. And then as you think about eventually getting this business get past – a lot of the focus obviously currently on this call about the near-term Industrial weakness, but you do have this target you want to eventually get to for the 2017 to 2019, and now Todd is in place in the air business. Other than cost take-outs to deal with the tougher current volumes, what are the key things you think you need to clear in order to get this to be a higher-margin business a few years out?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"So the material handling piece, Shannon, probably hit for 1.5 points, maybe up to 2 points right there. So I think really an underestimation as to what the impact would be across the segment of the material handling business. So add 1.5 points there. I figure currency at least stops moving against us at some point and flattens out. That's going to be helpful to us. And then any volume we see there, we'd be leveraging that at 30%, 35% on that front.\", \"So there's been very soft productivity in that business, as I mentioned, particularly as it relates to the integration, that work in the back half, work, once we saw the revenue outlook deteriorates through 2015. So, it's not a productivity issue. It's, again, if you look at a business like material handling, a small business with that sort of an impact – you look at currency, which they get not only translation but there's a much larger transactional component there, where it doesn't make sense for us to have too many factories at the machining and so on and so forth, so if you're putting those in the wrong part of the world it's hard to move those and you're going to absorb some of that headwind for a while.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Okay, great. Thanks.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Hey, listen, I think that we'll update you when we're together for the Analyst Meeting, Todd will sit again (1:01:49) in that seat and give you a point of view on that. And then Robert Zafari will clearly tell you kind of the other pieces of this as well, which have material impact as they're very high-margin businesses.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'All right. Thanks a lot.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.', 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', 'Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', \"I think this has been asked a little bit already, but maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the Industrial assumption for flat growth given the orders have been decelerating. Just maybe, some color there on what's driving that expectation.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, you look at 2009 when we saw customers abandoning equipments, shutting plants, we're not seeing that in 2015, we're not likely to see it in 2016. We're seeing customers that are just reducing CapEx. So, you're not seeing large machines as an example.\", \"Now, large machines, both Cameron and existing Ingersoll-Rand, were about 10% of the total business. Now, we'll see parts and service probably in the mid- to high-single-digit range next year as these older systems need to be maintained and serviced. We even saw that begin to materialize in the back half of 2015. So again, 10% of the Compression Technology business being big machines, 45-ish percent being services. And then remember, too, you got Club Car, the tools and the fluid business which should be a tailwind. However, material handling will continue to be a headwind again going into 2016 there.\", 'So, net that all out and the best view we have is that that math works to about negative 1 to 1.', 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', \"Got you. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of, well, a housekeeping question on the Hussmann adjustment. I think you talked about $55 million from Hussmann and asbestos. I think those two items through the third quarter were just under $30 million. So, was there like a big Hussmann 4Q, or maybe you can just unpack that a little bit? That would be helpful. Thanks.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"No, the Hussmann result in the fourth quarter were fairly normal with what they've been throughout 2015. So that really didn't have an impact. It was right on where we would have guided at the end of October.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"We'll look at what you're talking about, though, and follow back up if there's more to that question.\", 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', 'Great.

Your line is now open.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'A lot of my questions have been answered, so maybe just first one, on the price/cost spread that you laid out there, Sue, if I think about how that pertains to Climate, threw the majority in there, am I to assume kind of normal volume leverage of that in the mid-20%s. Is that what you guys are essentially guiding to or am I missing something?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'No, I think that would be a good assumption.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Okay. And then just a follow-up. I know we've beaten the Industrial megatrend discussion to death. But thinking about Cameron backlog presumably coming into 2016, that's a little bit lower. Probably, particularly low in the first quarter given that is more of a 4Q-weighted business. Is that something that is contemplating guidance? How should we think about that as maybe a headwind to the broader reading out of just comps getting easier on some of the resource industries and the service piece being an offset?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Josh, no doubt we're going to see weaker big machine revenues. That's forecast into what we're doing. What we found here as an operator of the business is that the pricing in March in some of that big stuff is not very good. It's really around the service and longevity of those systems over time as opposed to sort of the impact on sale in the quarter and delivery.\", \"So really, what we need to make up there in the weakness is service, parts. And in some of the smaller machines including oil-free and segments of the market that will continue to grow like pharmaceutical, food and beverage end markets where it's more consumer-driven, say, than it would be through heavy industry.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Got you.

Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions.\", 'Starting with full year 2015, it was a year that I can characterize best by one word and that word is volatility; volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market.', 'During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each of it ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headline results were essentially right on the forecast we gave you a year ago.', 'The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74; our actual is $3.73. That performance was with significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind for currency in guidance, it ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million.', \"We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control while doing our best to anticipate the things we couldn't control and we made adjustments accordingly.\", '2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multi-year strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, mature and key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets.', \"We have consistently delivered on our commitments even in volatile times, and we hope that you'd agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost five years ago, we've met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions.\", 'For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes FX and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low-single digits.', 'Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. In a fairly diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015.', 'We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points.', \"We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend with a 16% increase in 2015 and we announced an additional 10% increase of dividend last week.\", 'We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015. And more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011.', 'In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussman, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016.', 'Please go to slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. As shown here, the last five years, our operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011 despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015.

Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%.', 'The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics, and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our lean operating system and overhead costs discipline, together outpacing other inflation. Foreign exchange was a drag to margins of 50 basis points.', 'We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems, and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business.

The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1% excluding foreign exchange.

And our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Hey, guys. Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Morning, Steve.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Just a couple of questions. On the first quarter dynamics, you have a decent organic growth rate but it doesn't look like there's much contribution from operations on EPS. What's going on there?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"So, Steve, good morning, first of all. As we start to look at the first quarter bridge that you can actually see in the slides, what we're looking at is we've got restructuring costs that are in the first quarter. Our operating results are really going to be in the range of – and this includes the restructuring – negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year.\", \"So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so, I think the first quarter is just going to be a tough compares and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. So in Industrial, that makes a bit of a sense. On this gain you guys are going to take, Mike, given the environment has clearly gotten worse over the course of the last year, you guys are doing some degree of restructuring, and you don't typically do this over time like other companies, but any thoughts to maybe using this gain to perhaps take a bigger swipe at things and get out in front of some restructuring that you may have planned for a couple of years into the future, just to kind of solidify that ability to kind of execute and deliver, like you've been doing over the last year? Is there a bigger restructuring out there, I guess, a potential for that?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, I think, Steve, when you go back to 2009, we've been really consistent about particularly the factory footprint, and that's at a place right now where I think it's very productive, it's well utilized. And when we looked at ideas around us coming into 2016, paybacks were in the range of, say, five years to eight years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable.\", \"That being said, when you look at areas of the business particularly around Compression Technologies, there is restructuring taking place there. And largely, it's in the areas of head count and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So, tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So, there is a sort of drumbeat over time of doing that, but it's an effective and efficient – relatively effective and efficient footprint.\", \"One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten at lean, the further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder it is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain I think open-minded, Steve. If in fact things deteriorated further, if in fact we saw an opportunity, we certainly would look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we've made internally inside the company to this point.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Okay, great. Thanks a lot.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.

The execution is certainly a lot better than many of your so-called high-quality peers. So, well done on 3Q, 4Q.', \"I just wondered if I could maybe pick up on Steve's point about – very clear answer on restructuring, but I guess the two areas that pushed back for 2016 plan would be flat Industrial and maybe flat TK. So, I'm wondering if those come in weaker through the year, to what extent do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate the deleverage that you'd see if those do come in weaker.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yes, Nigel, listen, again, I'll pick it up from the point of Steve, this is where investments would be metered down. A lot of investments we're making are not only in product but in channel, and also letting attrition at times work for you. So, we will continue to work that down.\", \"We certainly have a plan to sustain a lower revenue outlook if we see that. It's baked within the guidance we've provided – the range that we've provided. And our focus really is on the Industrial segment and it's fundamentally on the Compression Technologies piece. Todd's all over it. He's well into several months now into the role. I think he's got his eyes wide open around the opportunities. He's optimistic around what he's doing and I've got confidence in Todd and the team that they've got the plans hardwired for lots of different scenarios at this point.\", 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Okay. Well, I'll pick up offline. And secondly, obviously you'd be aware that there's a pretty fertile debate about non-resi in North America given the broader weakness in industrial complex. The high-single digit growth in bookings during the quarter suggests that you're still seeing relatively fertile end markets. But maybe just pick up on where you stand and perhaps maybe comment on how the front is looking (30:43) right now.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, I think the surprise in the fourth quarter, at least to me, was the strength that we had both in applied and unitary in North America. We had double-digit applied bookings in the fourth quarter and we had mid-teens booking in unitary in the fourth quarter. So as a backdrop going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that.\", \"Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high-single-digit growth in services. And controls was up nearly double digits there. So, it feels like we've caught a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully, that's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills into K-to-12 as well. So, that continues.\", \"And then, as you'd expect, just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So, it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year.\", 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, Mike.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Nigel.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Thank you. Just a question around the Climate margin guidance. It looks like you're guiding for a 40%-plus incremental margin in Climate for 2016 overall. Maybe looking at slide 15, you might have some mix headwinds in that segment this year with Resi growing so strongly, Thermo King and Trane Asia being flat to down. So I just wondered what you're embedding for mix in Climate for the year ahead.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"So, Julian, as we think about where Climate is going to go in 2016, I think you're right. You hit some of the high points. So we still see the continued trends in what we talked about in terms of Commercial HVAC in the Americas being strong, in EMEA being up, but on the Asia side being down a little bit. We called Residential up mid-single digits. You also have the factors of Latin America as part of the business. And while you have some growth in those sides, you've also got the transport revenues being flat in 2016.\", \"So I think it's all of those mix pieces could strengthen on the commercial side in North America and Europe, a little down on the Asia side, flat Transport, down on Latin America and good mid-single digit growth in Res.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Okay. So mix is sort of broadly neutral then, 2016 versus 2015 in Climate?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Julian, Residential, if you look at the peer group, we're right at the top of the pack in terms of profitability. I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement that we've had at Residential business. So good Residential growth is good for us. It's fine.\", \"On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs, we had good growth for the year, we had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3 to 1 ratio; if we sell three APUs, that's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I'd point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely and, as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful than North American trailer. So net-net, we're good.\", \"Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft, the market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. Price/material was a 30 bps tailwind for the quarter and the year in 2015. Are you assuming sort of similar-ish for the year ahead?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"We are. Again, you're absolutely right with we ended the fourth quarter with 30 basis points and full year 2015 at 30 basis points to 40 basis points. For 2016, we're going to expect a 30 basis point to 40 basis point range for that gap or that spread between price and direct material inflation. You do have higher material deflation numbers. As you'll recall, we had inflation in the first and second quarters of 2015, so you do get a lift out of that. But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all-in-all it's going to come back to about that same 30 basis point to 40 basis point range in 2016 is what we saw.\", \"One of the other points, and you didn't ask this but I think it's relevant when we're having this discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some and there still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to compare year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Very helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.', 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"Hi. Good morning. A couple quick questions. First, acquisition pipeline. Can you give us a little feel for where you're feeling the opportunities are presenting themselves most, be it geographic, end market, however you want to address the question?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Really, David, the strategy for us has been to look at all the SBU's core businesses across all markets. And so there's a pipeline that would reflect all that from that perspective.\", \"There are two fundamental areas that we see for investment. One is channel. We continue to see opportunities, whether it's geographically outside the U.S. for channel or even in the U.S. in terms of buying back commercial distribution. That's a continued emphasis for us.\", \"We also find that when we can take a product, it might be a technology that we don't have, and sell it through our existing channel, particularly on the Trane Commercial side, we do very, very well with that. So obviously it's more attractive if you're buying anything that's (38:21) outside the U.S. And so we're pretty active looking outside the U.S. for a lot of that, which can be then modified and brought into the U.S. with different power requirements and different efficiency ratings, but some of the technologies can be applied. So we're seeing an active pipeline there as well.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'And given the balance sheet power and the cash flow, would you care to give us any sense of bigger than a breadbasket-type sizing of what kind of size deals are you looking at currently?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, probably, David, truthfully that would only get us into trouble I think by doing a big breadbasket estimates. I think that you can look at where we would end the year in terms of ratios. In terms of EBITDA to debt, we end the year around the 2.4 times range. There's obviously some capacity with some of the current debt rating. We've got the cash. We talked about in the call the $675 million that's unidentified. So, there is an opportunity to do something a little bit larger. But what we're generally seeing though are small- to mid-sized deals that just make great economic sense.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', 'Okay. A couple of quick things. Tax rate, with the IRS settlement now behind us, can you give us some guidance on how you think about the tax rate, be it this year, next year? I saw the tax rate guidance. I must admit, I was looking for a little lower tax rate in 2016 given the IRS settlement. But can you give us some guidelines how to model the next few years?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Sure. So, we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016. I think that when you think about the IRS settlement, what the IRS settlement really does is it takes the risk profile off the company and it puts to bed all of the issues around intercompany debt and any issues that would have been in the 2001, 2002 through 2011 range. But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate.\", \"So, what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now, having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity. And we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at.\", \"So, we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be.\", 'But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rate. And that is, when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate.', \"So, that's a long way around saying we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth.\", 'David Raso - Evercore ISI', \"All right. So in speaking quickly on cushions, just making sure, the corporate expense – I know there's rounding and you have to give ranges on segments and so forth, but it does seem to be implying your corporate expense goes up 10%, $230 million versus $210 million last year. Is that a rounding issue or should we really think that corporate expense is going up that much? But if you back from a total EBIT sort of implied by the segments, it is a larger number than I would have assumed.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Well, so it's not really rounding, but as we look at corporate expenses and – so, if you think back at 2015, where we started the year with our guidance was about $235 million, may sound familiar, and we ended the year at $210 million on the corporate side.\", 'When we look at 2016, we took a lot of discretionary spend out of 2015. There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cyber security. And we also have on the corporate side. So, we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll-Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in the elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016.', \"So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is and in looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets. So, it's a long way of saying that the $230 million, $235 million range is a lot more normal than $210 million but we're going to watch it closely and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the money is spent very well and to the level that we need to.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"David, if you take the run rate plus the pension, you're right, there was a little bit of gap there which we would normally apply to things like IT infrastructure and security that we're on a program too to refresh. But, look, if the markets turn down, we would just look to pull back from a discretionary standpoint in other areas in corporate. So, there's a little bit of flex in it that we would take if the markets are a little bit rougher than we think.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.

Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, Steve, look, a great of example of that was what happened within Compression Technologies. If you take the legacy business, it ran almost flat on much lower volume. So, a great example of that. That was a extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops out on productivity and discretionary spending and really to win in the marketplace.', \"It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition. Typically, it's denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and service side of the business. So, that's a great example.\", \"I would say that where we try to leverage it in the gross range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range but not to exceed 25% to 30%. So, that would be sort of the essence of that. It's going to depend a bit on the business.\", \"I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think, it doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think, largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so, we're really turning on and off sort of factory production and we got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So, a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"And, Steve, just to add on to what Mike said on the Industrial side, when I step back and think about Industrial, I kind of think about three big buckets that impacted that. Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So, over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So, you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron. Again, took that on. You knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015.\", \"And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works, the air business gets the benefit out of some of that but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so, when you say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization, so I'd think about that in the total inflation, too.\", 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Okay, thanks. And then, as a follow-up to an earlier question. You talked a lot about the price versus material deflation rage, spread, but a little more on the pricing environment itself absent material, what are you seeing in your big businesses in pricing, what kind of behavior are you seeing?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, both businesses in the fourth quarter are positive-priced, which is pretty outstanding, frankly, across-the-board, and that's with pressure in Climate in Asia and of course with Industrial pressure all over the world, still able to get price in that business. So, we're still seeing positive price albeit it's pretty thin in the quarter. So that's, I think, a good indicator of sort of pricing power and just sort of the pricing structure within the industry holds pretty well through tougher times.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'And that same will hold for 2016, with both segments projecting positive price for 2016.', 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Okay, thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Jeff.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Hey. Just back to Industrial for a moment, Mike. Just thinking about the margins sequentially, if Cameron hit its targets and with the sequential revenue that you just had seasonally, I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit better there.', 'Can you just kind of walk us through that? And then, just help reconcile this a little bit, how we get comfortable with the kind of flattish Industrial for the year coming off this Q4 order number? Is there something in particular that you see in the pipeline that gives you some confidence in that number?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Jeff, I'll start and then I'll let Sue finish. But what I think a lot of folks don't recognize when we talk about Industrial is impact that material handling and tools would have. Material handling is really exclusively oil and gas for us. It's 7% (50:34) of that segment has been hit incredibly hard. And, frankly, the tools business was hit very hard by that business as well.\", \"Highest-margin businesses in the portfolio. And so when those go down, you feel it. It's a substantial headwind buried inside the segment numbers that's independent of what's happening with Cameron or Compression in general.\", \"The other thing, if you go back to Compression Technologies specifically is we do very well from a margin perspective historically in Asia and in Latin America. And so from a mix perspective, when those markets are down, and they've been absolutely clobbered, we feel that as well from a mix perspective.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Right. And so, let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so, I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that that roadmap, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components.\", 'So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the four components of the business with the plant, air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial markets, and so that book and turn business definitely took a downturn in 2015.', \"You also have tough markets with oil prices. So on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you got fewer projects. You've got the same number of competitors, and so you've got some tough markets there. Then, you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity.\", \"Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies – not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business. And we're going to continue to do that.\", \"So, the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago. But I think as we look to the business and what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Jeff, too, lots maybe in this is really strong execution here by the team integrating it. It'll turn out that the synergy in this thing will be about 15% of Cameron's revenues. So, that's double the synergies we thought we would have, which is a good thing because, obviously, the top line is much weaker and that's the reason it's still accretive from cash EPS perspective in the year.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', \"Just one housekeeping item. The release says there's $250 million of repo in Q4 and $250 million in January. That $250 million in Q4 is really referring to a full year number, correct? Was there some settlement issue or something else that I'm missing there? It looks like you did $233 million through nine months.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'I think that was in October and we had some settlements in September. So there...', 'Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations', 'Late October, we said we had spent I think $233 million and $250 million by the end of October, yes.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Did you catch that?', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Not completely, no.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Okay, sorry. We were joining in on the response in the room and I apologize for that. So we did do the $250 million in the fourth quarter. We talked about that roughly in the third quarter call. And then we had a separate 10b5-1 program that repurchased $250 million in January.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Right.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', '$250 million quarter four, $250 million quarter one.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', \"All right. I'll follow up. It says $233 million in the Q3 10-Q. That's why I'm confused. But I'll follow up.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"That's right. So, yeah. So what happened there, Jeff, so you're absolutely right. At the time we released earnings for the third quarter, which would have been the third week in October, we had not settled out the entire $250 million. So there was a little bit of leakage that was over into the remainder, but it was an October event.\", \"So in other words, we were announcing that we had gone into the market just like we are now. We're not talking about the first quarter, but in the first quarter we repurchased the $250 million, we had repurchased $233 million in October and the total was $250 million for the fourth quarter.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.', 'Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC', \"Thank you and good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to Residential HVAC, I was hoping you'd give a little more commentary on the mix of new buying versus repair. Have you seen any change in behavior there and I guess any margin implication this might have?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, clearly we're seeing more that's not so much new construction and repair, it's largely new construction and replacement. And so we're moving back now towards replacement. Replacement is a very good place for us. We've got really good shares there as compared to new construction where shares are lower. So when the market moves toward replacement, we generally do much better and you saw that in the high-teens bookings in the fourth quarter and the overall good performance that we had in 2015, where we had really excellent performance in 2015.\", 'Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC', 'Okay, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on China just by segment and then also you touched on VRF trends.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, China, it's still rough. We're not seeing great progress in China in either business. Having said that, we're somewhat in a trough and we didn't see it really dip further in the quarter in quarter four. We saw great strength outside of China, so Singapore, Thailand, India, really sort of...\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Hong Kong.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', '...Hong Kong, kind of made the day for us relative to Asia. So, nice to see those markets finally recovering on that front.', \"VRF continues to do very well for us, continues to grow at or above the pace of our unitary business. And we continue to have a very high share in North America, parts of South America in the VRF business. And I think, as you know, we don't play a big role outside of those territories, we play a small role in China largely in commercial VRF or in hybrid systems.\", 'Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC', 'Okay. Thank you. That was it.', 'Operator', \"Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, Shannon.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", \"Hey. Mike, in terms of the acquisitions and the currency impact on Industrial this year, I think it seems like every quarter they've been almost 200 basis points. Maybe Sue could provide us the split of what that was for 2015. How much was the acquisition impact, how much was currency? And then next year I'm assuming the acquisition impact year-over-year goes away but you still have some currency. Maybe help us on how those headwinds change.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"It's split about 50/50 in 2015. It was about 1 point both. So, translational and transactional would have been about 1 point and acquisitions would have been about 1 point of headwind.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'And for 2016?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"No acquisition headwind because everything based on the calendar, it was all a 2015 start and finish. So there's nothing there. On the FX side, it's going to be, again, a pretty tough row to hoe, probably 4 points of headwind coming into revenues and we'd see normal leverage against that. So it's probably 30 basis points, 40 basis points coming at us on that front.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Okay.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'And to your question on the full year of 2015, so the overall operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the math would work out roughly the same if you took out the foreign exchange and the acquisitions, that that would be the majority of what the decrement was in the overall operating margin percentage.', \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Okay. And then as you think about eventually getting this business get past – a lot of the focus obviously currently on this call about the near-term Industrial weakness, but you do have this target you want to eventually get to for the 2017 to 2019, and now Todd is in place in the air business. Other than cost take-outs to deal with the tougher current volumes, what are the key things you think you need to clear in order to get this to be a higher-margin business a few years out?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"So the material handling piece, Shannon, probably hit for 1.5 points, maybe up to 2 points right there. So I think really an underestimation as to what the impact would be across the segment of the material handling business. So add 1.5 points there. I figure currency at least stops moving against us at some point and flattens out. That's going to be helpful to us. And then any volume we see there, we'd be leveraging that at 30%, 35% on that front.\", \"So there's been very soft productivity in that business, as I mentioned, particularly as it relates to the integration, that work in the back half, work, once we saw the revenue outlook deteriorates through 2015. So, it's not a productivity issue. It's, again, if you look at a business like material handling, a small business with that sort of an impact – you look at currency, which they get not only translation but there's a much larger transactional component there, where it doesn't make sense for us to have too many factories at the machining and so on and so forth, so if you're putting those in the wrong part of the world it's hard to move those and you're going to absorb some of that headwind for a while.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'Okay, great. Thanks.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Hey, listen, I think that we'll update you when we're together for the Analyst Meeting, Todd will sit again (1:01:49) in that seat and give you a point of view on that. And then Robert Zafari will clearly tell you kind of the other pieces of this as well, which have material impact as they're very high-margin businesses.\", \"Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC\", 'All right. Thanks a lot.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.', 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', 'Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', \"I think this has been asked a little bit already, but maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the Industrial assumption for flat growth given the orders have been decelerating. Just maybe, some color there on what's driving that expectation.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, you look at 2009 when we saw customers abandoning equipments, shutting plants, we're not seeing that in 2015, we're not likely to see it in 2016. We're seeing customers that are just reducing CapEx. So, you're not seeing large machines as an example.\", \"Now, large machines, both Cameron and existing Ingersoll-Rand, were about 10% of the total business. Now, we'll see parts and service probably in the mid- to high-single-digit range next year as these older systems need to be maintained and serviced. We even saw that begin to materialize in the back half of 2015. So again, 10% of the Compression Technology business being big machines, 45-ish percent being services. And then remember, too, you got Club Car, the tools and the fluid business which should be a tailwind. However, material handling will continue to be a headwind again going into 2016 there.\", 'So, net that all out and the best view we have is that that math works to about negative 1 to 1.', 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', \"Got you. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of, well, a housekeeping question on the Hussmann adjustment. I think you talked about $55 million from Hussmann and asbestos. I think those two items through the third quarter were just under $30 million. So, was there like a big Hussmann 4Q, or maybe you can just unpack that a little bit? That would be helpful. Thanks.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"No, the Hussmann result in the fourth quarter were fairly normal with what they've been throughout 2015. So that really didn't have an impact. It was right on where we would have guided at the end of October.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"We'll look at what you're talking about, though, and follow back up if there's more to that question.\", 'Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP', 'Great.

Your line is now open.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'A lot of my questions have been answered, so maybe just first one, on the price/cost spread that you laid out there, Sue, if I think about how that pertains to Climate, threw the majority in there, am I to assume kind of normal volume leverage of that in the mid-20%s. Is that what you guys are essentially guiding to or am I missing something?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', 'No, I think that would be a good assumption.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Okay. And then just a follow-up. I know we've beaten the Industrial megatrend discussion to death. But thinking about Cameron backlog presumably coming into 2016, that's a little bit lower. Probably, particularly low in the first quarter given that is more of a 4Q-weighted business. Is that something that is contemplating guidance? How should we think about that as maybe a headwind to the broader reading out of just comps getting easier on some of the resource industries and the service piece being an offset?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Josh, no doubt we're going to see weaker big machine revenues. That's forecast into what we're doing. What we found here as an operator of the business is that the pricing in March in some of that big stuff is not very good. It's really around the service and longevity of those systems over time as opposed to sort of the impact on sale in the quarter and delivery.\", \"So really, what we need to make up there in the weakness is service, parts. And in some of the smaller machines including oil-free and segments of the market that will continue to grow like pharmaceutical, food and beverage end markets where it's more consumer-driven, say, than it would be through heavy industry.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Got you.

Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions.\", 'Starting with full year 2015, it was a year that I can characterize best by one word and that word is volatility; volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market.', 'During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each of it ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headline results were essentially right on the forecast we gave you a year ago.', 'The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74; our actual is $3.73. That performance was with significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind for currency in guidance, it ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million.', \"We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control while doing our best to anticipate the things we couldn't control and we made adjustments accordingly.\", '2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multi-year strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, mature and key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets.', \"We have consistently delivered on our commitments even in volatile times, and we hope that you'd agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost five years ago, we've met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions.\", 'For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes FX and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low-single digits.', 'Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. In a fairly diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015.', 'We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%.

And more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011.', 'In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussman, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016.', 'Please go to slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins.

Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%.', 'The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics, and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our lean operating system and overhead costs discipline, together outpacing other inflation.

Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points.', 'In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and, if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%.', 'Now please go to slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5% excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding, so organic revenue is also up 5%.', 'Organic Commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digit and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits while EMEA and Latin America were both up low-single digit. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia.', 'Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high-single digit versus prior year. Thermo King organic revenues were down low-single digits, with truck/trailer revenue up high-single digits, with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year.', \"The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter.\", 'Now please go to slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and', 'Services, power tools, fluid management and material handling organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low-single digits and were up high-single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. Club Car revenues excluding foreign exchange were up slightly versus prior year.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower organic revenues.\", 'The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets. However, synergies were above our acquisition model and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive.', 'Please go to slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect our working capital to be in the 4% range.', 'Now go to slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent, at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion as a percent of adjusted net earnings was 101% for the year. As you can see when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That range excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018.', \"Please go to slide 14. Over the last five years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We employ a dynamic model for capital allocation, which adjusts based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the rate used for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last five years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers.\", \"We've repurchased 103 million shares in the past five years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January and were able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We repurchased 4.9 million shares in January.\", 'To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due to the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses. So, a normal timing for share repurchases would have been in the second half. But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.', 'For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value accretive acquisitions and share repurchases based upon relative valuation and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders.', \"For the ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive.\", \"And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer', \"Great. Thanks, Sue, and please go to slide 15. It is always our intention, is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends.\", 'North American Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC as well as transport and Commercial HVAC markets in Europe are generally positive while global industrial markets remain weak. Transport markets in the Americas will be flat to down as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products. The Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down. Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up. All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis.', \"We're forecasting low-single digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total, mid-single digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North American business for us, and flat revenues in transport. We expect air and industrial products, which includes our Compression Technologies, power tools, material handling and fluid management SBUs, to be down low-single digits and we expect Club Car to be up low-single digits.\", \"Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron's Centrifugal Compressor division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast.\", 'Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1% excluding foreign exchange. Industrial also has a high proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate. So Industrial experiences more impact of FX as compared to Climate, 3 points adverse impact versus 2 points in Climate.', \"For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75%. And for the Enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.50% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all-in and about 3% (21:04) excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 basis points to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis.\", 'Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015.', 'As a note, for 2016 FX as a headwind is about $0.02 to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro, average rate for the euro is $1.03, but for the first quarter the euro forecast rate is $1.06. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and average diluted share count of 260 million shares for the full year.', 'As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocated all excess cash to share buyback and phased it to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This does not necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash, but was done to simplify modeling.', \"The EPS outlook does not include the impact of the divestiture of our stake at Hussman. We expect that transaction to close April 1, resulting in a gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing but we'll adjust out the gain for comparability.\", \"First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33, adding back $0.05 restructuring to get to an adjusted basis of the EPS range of $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance.\", 'For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussman of $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will more than offset dilution from equity issuances.', 'We had $143 million of commercial paper at year-end. And after paying that down, it leaves about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize when there is additional share repurchase or towards M&A. We continue to build a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value.', \"In closing, we're pleased to deliver another solid year with top quartile performance in revenue and earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of these strategies.\", \"We proactively work to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We'll continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems, as well as further developing our people and our operating capabilities.

Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses.\", \"Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I said before, critical to any sustained cultural transformation, our employees are engaged, their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll-Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.\", \"Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full-year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat. Now this morning I'm going to you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year.\", \"I thought it would be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy, and then I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year.\", \"So over the past 16 weeks I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams.\", \"And as always I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us.\", \"With that, let's go to slide 4. And I'm going to note that all my comments are on an organic basis so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. And I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC recent, put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth. And we believe this should continue through at least 2017.\", 'We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets, within the institutional markets; education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter coupled with high-single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out too that we expect to see a record for quarter two with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter two as a result of some large institutional project awards.', \"We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we've seen growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter one of 2016 with double-digit growth in our controls and service business. With over 4,300 company direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVA service to commercial customers in the world.\", \"Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs. Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.\", \"I'm occasionally asked what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll-Rand, and in reading some of the sell-side reports I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you. According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter over the past six quarters including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter one of 2016, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter one brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high-single-digit range for the year.\", \"The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies, and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential Controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.\", 'Shifting to North America and transport refrigeration markets, as usual the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year.', 'ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, and their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%. We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast to approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance from last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.', 'Our truck refrigeration business was also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to Class 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.', 'As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth.', 'We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high-single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake of the new product introductions. And like North America, the service business also grew at a double-digit rate.', \"I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made in the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With the FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.\", \"Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and it's not that consistent month to month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on in increasing our direct channel market investment to achieve fuller market coverage.\", \"Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter one and up low-teens for Asia Pacific as a whole. Our strategic focus on growing the service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow, and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences. Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia.\", 'So concluding, the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update would take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remain fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we are pleased with our performance in the market. We have expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace.', \"Let's move to slide five. And here we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low-single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focused in growing our service businesses across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy.\", 'In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds at utilization readings above 80%.', \"On one visit I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 gallons to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this PhD physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying it's when the telephone rings, and fortunately he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours in that area.\", \"So whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is to that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016.\", 'To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, when you look at compressors between five horsepower and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between five horsepower and 15 horsepower, is off roughly 10%, while compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first two industry-reported months of the quarter. Smaller compressors quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book and turn with inventory re-stocking occurring in that category.', 'We also believe we are seeing some re-stocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business. Our material handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business we have a management team doing a very good job exhibiting strong cost control, execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines in projected global market growth.', \"In Europe we're seeing increased exports to industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea. And China's power consumption index has also shown growth in the first two months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.\", \"So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.\", 'So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating systems to deliver well above industry average results.', \"Now I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let costs get ahead of revenues in the quarter.\", 'Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5% both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter, with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015.', 'Large centrifugal compressors and other Industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth. Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.', 'Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1 our capital deployment actions included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter.', \"Please go to slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments, and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance.\", 'Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.', 'Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range (18:44).', 'Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and will spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.', 'Please go to slide right. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.', 'We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Regionally for commercial HVAC, we saw high-single-digit booking increases with a high-single-digit increase in North America and Europe, up low-teens in Asia, and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America.', 'Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low-single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low-single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car.', 'Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors while freeing (20:23) in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.', \"Please go to slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.\", 'Our Industrial segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe while Asia was flat and North America was down high-single digits.', \"Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control.\", 'Please go to slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.', 'Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.', 'Please go to slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 basis points and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4% respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending. The leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America.', 'Europe had low-single digit equipment growth and high-single digits in services and trucking and (24:00) parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales. Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement.', 'First quarter organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.', 'Please go to slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low-single digits and were flat in Asia.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.6% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive, productivity offset other inflation, and volume and mix were unfavorable.\", 'Please go to slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability.', \"For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we're well-positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier-volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.\", \"Please go to slide 14.

We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.\", 'North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volume has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets.', \"Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-American – North American business for us; and a small increase in transport.

Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full-year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about two percentage points. While these revenue outlets do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates. We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.', \"For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margin. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points.

Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence that this won't be crated. (31:39). Our operating system is gaining momentum. And I'm confident in our management team, and we feel good about our forecast for the remainder of the year.\", 'So with that, Sue and I will take your questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Hi, good morning, guys.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Josh.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Morning.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Just on the price-cost equation here, clearly a pretty strong contribution in the first quarter. Can you help us with how that dimensions out, just based on purchasing agreements and hedges you already have in place, over the balance of the year?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Absolutely. So you're right. The 160 basis point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis because last year we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points.\", \"But what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half-second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, though Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where I think you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a big execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment.\", \"But as it comes to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally I think those are going to be pretty stable.\", \"We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment and I think we'll have a great result.\", 'So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year I think 30 basis points to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance. And as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Great. That's helpful. And then, Sue, just as a follow-up, I remember last quarter you talked about some of the toggles for the tax rate and specifically mentioned intercompany debt. Could you just maybe update us where we're at on the total tax strategy in light of some of the Treasury rulings?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Right. So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we've looked at all of the proposed Treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016.\", \"As we think about the tax strategy that I talked about, getting us into a low-20s% type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do – trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned, and other tax-efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go.\", \"We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs so that we're all working on taxes, we do our plans, and we do our forward looks. And I think that'll help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed Treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impact that might be out there from the regulations, but no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Perfect. Thanks for the answer.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"I guess my first question, maybe starting on Industrial where you did see decelerating trends. I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly there were some cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year. And so I'm just wondering is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial and I guess what's the strategy at this point?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Yeah. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year, and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about a $0.01 for each of the next three quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we look at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring, and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about Industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in.\", 'Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down, so bookings are up, which is good.', \"The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals. But also importantly as we think about ECC and that business is we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined.\", 'So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you see some strengths in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Joe, remember, too, that I think that we've been serial restructurers now for years, and that's both qualified and non-qualified. So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we are seeing in this business, we're getting numbers like seven years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running plants, utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants.\", \"If you couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, that's a 24-month to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any larger restructuring when this thing turns around because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious.\", \"So we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. So we're very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it. And we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'That makes sense, Mike. I guess maybe my follow-on question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say that 2Q North America commercial HVAC bookings were expected to be up about 25%?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yes, that's correct.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'And is that the reason for the organic revenue guidance raise?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"That's more of an impact in 2017 and it's got a little bit of a positive in 2016, a little bit of a positive in 2018. But the bulk of that would be 2017 shipments. So it's really the strength of the business across the board. Unitary continues to be strong. The pipeline looks strong for us. Europe has been a great success story. I think it will continue as well. And of course the residential business continues to put up some very big numbers.\", \"And so all of that combined has got more to do with the guidance increase than the large booking number in quarter two. By the way, quarter three should look pretty good for us as well. Although I don't have a prognostication on the percentage rate, it should be a good quarter for us.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Thank you. I just want to say thanks a lot to Janet for all the help, and all the best. In terms of the first question, that would really be back on the Industrial margins. They used to be at sort of 16%, 17% of the odd quarter here and there, and they are down to 9% to 10% right now. And the guidance embeds that by the end of the year I guess they climb back into the sort of low-teens in the next three quarters. So maybe just help clarify what's driving that sort of 400 point-plus margin recovery. Is it just about productivity or is there something going on with the mix as well of Industrial versus compression?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"So Julian, great question. On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct that in the back half of the year we do have the operating margins for Industrial improving into the low-teens. And as we look at what's going to happen in the back half of the year, it truly is productivity, still lower inflationary type of rates. So you've got productivity offsetting other inflation. You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front.\", \"I don't want anyone to think there is a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this; we have not. But there is by virtue of how the quarters pan out roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and market decline.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"There was also, Julian, the cost control there is exceptional. So even though you were seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring, there's at least that much, maybe more than that which would be non-qualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or fulfilling spending. So there is a cost for that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around head count, some of which is qualified, some of which is non-qualified in terms of how we would actually account for it.\", 'The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through when we would see a 17% margin business.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"All right. That's great. So when I look at it – so the first thing that we did is we went back and said at the time that we gave the original 17% margin guidance for the Industrial business, the revenues in the business were in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory.\", \"So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and I think the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margin. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back.\", \"Right now, we haven't seen the markets actually stop falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return, but again I think the way I'm thinking about it is once the revenues get back up into the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion area where they were when we gave that guidance, that we'll be nearing those 17% type of margins for Industrial.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Remember, when you look at the gross margins of that business and look at the fixed cost of that business say relative to the Climate segment, you can see very easily why that business snaps back very strongly on volume. So when volume returns to that business, we'll get very aggressive incremental margins out of that. In the short term, we're controlling the heck out of costs the best we can. However, we're not going to spite our nose to save our face as it relates to capacity.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Thanks. And then just my follow-up quickly would be, on your overall firm-wide margin bridge, Q1 you had about 10 points or 10 bps from productivity and other inflation. I guess based on what you just said, should we think the number for the year ends up somewhere between that 10 bps and the sort of the 90 bps tailwind that you had last year for the year as a whole?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"I do think that you will – we do see other inflation to be higher in the first half versus the second half is when our salary increases takes place. That's when a lot of the benefits take place. So when I look at what we plan for the full year, I would say it probably looks more like 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year, Julian.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Perfect. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Nigel.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Good morning.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Hi. I really hope Janet isn't calling a peak here. I don't think she is. But thanks for all the help.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'She is fine.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"So this North American auto expenses is really interesting, Mike, and I'm assuming that's really driven by these large-type projects, finally some big spend (49:04). I'm just wondering what's changed here. I mean is it just a case of old equipment we're seeing here, so the extended replacement cycle can move through? Is it budgetary? I mean any color there would be helpful.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Nigel, I think all that's true, but the constant persistent investment we've made over five years, six years, seven years in that business, the constant investment in the channel and the service footprint is really paying off. And I just think the focus we've had on all of that development being around energy efficiency, sustainability, new refrigerant development, all of that is such a powerful story when you look at it.\", 'This is what we were waiting for. This is what we hoped to have seen, which is outsized growth relative to the market and outsized profitability or margin expansion relative to the market. So this is a huge effort by lots of people all the way through to the technicians providing service on the street for us. This is a real accomplishment.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Okay. And obviously very early to call 2017 at this point, but if you just look at your North American commercial HVAC operations based on the backlog of pipeline, is it reasonable to assume that perhaps you might see some acceleration next year?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, the thing you have to think about though is what happens to the office and retail business. As an example, our national accounts business has been doing extremely well into retail. Office building is doing really well, as you can see, kind of the high-teens bookings rate again. Unitary, that's been strong again.\", \"Some point you'd think that that would begin to subside and be replaced by stronger applied growth, which I think will happen. So I think what you end up with is maybe a change in the mix between unitary and applied, but I do think continued strong performance through 2017.\", 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Great. Thanks, Mike. That's helpful.\", 'Operator', 'And our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Hey, guys. Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Steve.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Good morning.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"On the Climate side, I mean just a very big margin number, obviously, and I'm trying to just wrap my head around the seasonality dynamics, 1Q to 2Q. In the last couple years you've had increases, like in 2014 you guys saw a doubling or almost a tripling of the profit number in Climate. Can you just maybe speak to maybe what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is the seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things, or just maybe help us square that, just with the first quarter basis so high that just having trouble kind of getting low enough in Climate.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Steve, so I think that looking at something certainly in the 16% margin range for the entire segment is going to make a lot of sense for us. Again, to Sue's point, price I think subsides a little bit, material inflation kind of clips along pretty much at the same rate, bookings look good, pipeline looks fairly strong. We're not seeing – the container business on the transport side being down of course is not all that problematic for us in terms of margins as long as European trailer and North American trailer are doing well. So you put that all together and you're probably dealing with something in the 16% range.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Can you at some point soon kind of get to that 17%? Will you kind of hit that at some point this year?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"I don't know. I mean, really looking at Q3 and Q4 at that level of granularity around guidance, Steve, I don't know. I mean Q2 is seasonally a pretty good quarter for us. Quarter three can be. So we've got an outside shot at something like that.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Okay. And then just on the kind of go-forward leverage, so you had this nice pop off the bottom on margins. Should we continue to expect that if this kind of current mix holds, that if commercial HVAC does really continue to roll on here and we have a bit more of an extended cycle than I think most people were expecting probably three months to four months ago, can you still leverage that business really well, or do you have to add cost or anything like that? I mean I feel like you got to have plenty of capacity here to let it rip a little bit before you start to throw money at the business from a capacity perspective, right?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, the service business and the controls business are growing so well, too, and our margins are obviously much higher. So it's a little bit distorting about how we might think about fixed costs being factory costs. So I do think that there is some capacity we have even in our field service and controls capability that wouldn't require incremental investment. Obviously it's feet on the street, but we stay in front of that, and we typically hire long in the service business. So I don't see why having leverage for the full year – it starts with a 4 – would be a problem in the Climate business.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. And then one last quick one. You guys took up the price cost year-over-year by I think 40 bps you said, but you only took your margins up by 30 bps. Anything – that's just volume and mix at Industrial, is that kind of that moving part?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Well, inflation kicks in just in terms of wage increases beginning in April for the full year, and we kind of see sort of the cost increase there as well. Puts a little bit of a squeeze...', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Okay.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"...on margins there. But fundamentally, Steve, there's not anything really changing other than the fact that it's hard to believe that price would stay high as it normally is, and material inflation should stay about where it is, but we're looking at just closing that gap a little bit probably from the price side.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Great.

Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"I went – probably I saw five, six of our factories and operations in Europe a month ago. I met with the engineering teams. I saw product launching between August and December, Jeff. It's one of the best stories I've seen, absolutely the fastest cycle time between ideation and product launch. They're hitting it right on the money in terms of what the customers are looking for. It's been a great story for us on the ECC side in Europe.\", \"But I'll also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate in the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting. And the openness around that – and then the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', \"And then could you address what's going on in 14 SEER? Probably still early in the season to know for sure, but does that price gap versus legacy 13 SEER holding in that 10% to 15% range?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Yeah, Jeff, it is holding. And I think the great news about the 14 SEER is what we saw was the balance of 14 SEER and greater product is still about 80% of the revenues in 2016. So we're seeing price, we're seeing the favorable mix that we expected out of the product. And we're also seeing that the balance between 14 SEER and even the 15 SEER and above has not really changed, which does create a good environment as you alluded to with the price and cost differential.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'So is that 40 basis points of positive mix, Sue, that you elaborated all in residential? Did you actually have more than that in residential than you saw somewhere else?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'So it was not all residential. It was a combination of residential and also Thermo King. On the Thermo King side, and one of the things that we saw was we saw more strength than we expected in truck and trailer both in North America and in Europe. And then the big declines on Thermo King came from the marine container business that I said was down about 60%. So the 40 basis points of mix was primarily from res and from Thermo King. And my recollection is it was split pretty evenly.', 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBank Capital Markets. Your line is now open.', 'Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Hey. Good morning, guys.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Jeff.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Good morning.', 'Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Hey. So what's driving the 1Q order growth in residential, and what gives you the confidence to kind of move that forecast up ahead of the selling season?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, I mean first and foremost the product line really at this point has been fully developed, and we've hit stride, all the good success with the furnace product, all the good success with the new launches, the variable speed, growth in Nexia. All these things have just been really kind of coming together.\", \"Operationally, we just find the pipeline for projects and productivity and quality to be improving. Deliveries have been exceptional in terms of on-time delivery and having product available where you need it, when you need it, really investing in the warehousing and investing in the product availability. So just a sense here that things have gone right for a long time here and that we'll do better, particularly as the mix moves up north of 14 SEER, which it is. So as the mix moves north of 14 SEER, we do better anyway. And as the mix moves more toward replacement and away from new construction, we'll do better.\", 'Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', \"Okay. Great. And then how's the M&A pipeline kind of informing how you're thinking about buyback through the balance of the year?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"There is no doubt we want to grow the company and grow value over the long run. So we said we're looking at ideas and businesses that we know and run and are successful with. FRIGOBLOCK and Cameron were great examples; different examples but great examples of being able to take businesses, put them into an operating system, improve the businesses and deliver essentially what we said we were going to deliver from an accretion perspective. So we feel good about our capability in doing that.\", \"We also feel patient. We feel like we don't have to – we're not compelled to do anything around M&A. We've got great positions in the marketplace, and there's not a compelling need for us to go do something and potentially do something where we pay too much in that process.\", \"So, Jeff, we'll continue to evaluate that. When we see opportunities that fit the criteria we'll pull the trigger. And we clearly want to grow long-term value to the shareholder, and that's probably the best way to do it.\", \"With that being said, you couldn't pass up in January. The stock price dislocated 20% from the peer group. I mean we jumped in on that and acquired $250 million in January at $51 a share. So we're going to be dynamic, we're going to be opportunistic, and we're going to grow shareholder value. If that means we find the right bolt-ons to do that, we're going to jump on those, too.\", 'Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.', 'Okay. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.', 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', \"Thanks, and good morning. And also appreciate the additional detail in the disclosure today. It's helpful. Let's see. So first of all, Mike, how are you reconciling all of this discussion about commercial HVAC strong growth relative to what is pretty lackluster Dodge data, ABI, all these macro data points? Are you attributing it all to share, renovation, control, service? Just maybe a little clarity on that would be helpful.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, it's sort of all of the above, Steve, which is probably hard to give clarity on that. But if you take Latin America, we're up mid-teens in Latin America. That's clearly our people out in the street creating demand, making it happen. Mid-teens bookings growth in Asia. I mean Asia is not that strong. Again, our team is hitting the street.\", \"Europe, we talked about product development, and the pace of product development there is best-in-class in the company and product management, best we have in the company around getting exactly right on these product growth teams and understanding where we're competing, how we're going to win against very specific competitors in the market.\", \"These products launched, and they do exactly what they were supposed to do. That's a positive for us. So there's a lot of self-help here happening and the backdrop on the markets, with the exception of the Middle East, isn't bad. So you've got decent markets and really strong execution.\", 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', \"Okay. And how are you doing on – what's the growth rate on VRF in the quarter, progress, any developments there?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Last year we were about 30% growth. This year we're about the same, Steve. We continue to do well on the market. We continue to sell VRF. We're beginning to also see interest in what's referred to as four-pipe chiller. So this is simultaneous heat and cooling around water circulating through buildings versus refrigerant. It's big in Europe, picking up a little bit of interest in the U.S.\", \"The idea here is we're going to have whatever products are demanded in the marketplace, and then we're going to work with our customers to figure out what the best solution is for the building. And that's why our business was up 30% last year. It's why our business is up about the same this year as well.\", 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Okay. Great.

Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses.\", \"Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I said before, critical to any sustained cultural transformation, our employees are engaged, their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll-Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.\", \"Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full-year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat. Now this morning I'm going to you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year.\", \"I thought it would be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy, and then I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year.\", \"So over the past 16 weeks I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams.\", \"And as always I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us.\", \"With that, let's go to slide 4. And I'm going to note that all my comments are on an organic basis so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. And I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC recent, put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth. And we believe this should continue through at least 2017.\", 'We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets, within the institutional markets; education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter coupled with high-single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out too that we expect to see a record for quarter two with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter two as a result of some large institutional project awards.', \"We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we've seen growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter one of 2016 with double-digit growth in our controls and service business. With over 4,300 company direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVA service to commercial customers in the world.\", \"Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs. Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.\", \"I'm occasionally asked what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll-Rand, and in reading some of the sell-side reports I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you. According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter over the past six quarters including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter one of 2016, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter one brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high-single-digit range for the year.\", \"The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies, and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential Controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.\", 'Shifting to North America and transport refrigeration markets, as usual the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year.', 'ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, and their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%. We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast to approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance from last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.', 'Our truck refrigeration business was also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to Class 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.', 'As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth.', 'We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high-single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake of the new product introductions. And like North America, the service business also grew at a double-digit rate.', \"I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made in the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With the FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.\", \"Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and it's not that consistent month to month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on in increasing our direct channel market investment to achieve fuller market coverage.\", \"Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter one and up low-teens for Asia Pacific as a whole. Our strategic focus on growing the service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow, and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences. Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia.\", 'So concluding, the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update would take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remain fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we are pleased with our performance in the market. We have expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace.', \"Let's move to slide five. And here we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low-single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focused in growing our service businesses across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy.\", 'In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds at utilization readings above 80%.', \"On one visit I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 gallons to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this PhD physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying it's when the telephone rings, and fortunately he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours in that area.\", \"So whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is to that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016.\", 'To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, when you look at compressors between five horsepower and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between five horsepower and 15 horsepower, is off roughly 10%, while compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first two industry-reported months of the quarter. Smaller compressors quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book and turn with inventory re-stocking occurring in that category.', 'We also believe we are seeing some re-stocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business. Our material handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business we have a management team doing a very good job exhibiting strong cost control, execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines in projected global market growth.', \"In Europe we're seeing increased exports to industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea. And China's power consumption index has also shown growth in the first two months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.\", \"So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.\", 'So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating systems to deliver well above industry average results.', \"Now I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let costs get ahead of revenues in the quarter.\", 'Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5% both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter, with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015.', 'Large centrifugal compressors and other Industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth. Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.', 'Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1 our capital deployment actions included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter.', \"Please go to slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments, and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance.\", 'Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.', 'Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range (18:44).', 'Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and will spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.', 'Please go to slide right. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.', 'We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Regionally for commercial HVAC, we saw high-single-digit booking increases with a high-single-digit increase in North America and Europe, up low-teens in Asia, and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America.', 'Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low-single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low-single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car.', 'Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors while freeing (20:23) in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.', \"Please go to slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.\", 'Our Industrial segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe while Asia was flat and North America was down high-single digits.', \"Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control.\", 'Please go to slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.', 'Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.', 'Please go to slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 basis points and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4% respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending. The leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America.', 'Europe had low-single digit equipment growth and high-single digits in services and trucking and (24:00) parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales. Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement.', 'First quarter organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.', 'Please go to slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low-single digits and were flat in Asia.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.6% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive, productivity offset other inflation, and volume and mix were unfavorable.\", 'Please go to slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability.', \"For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we're well-positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier-volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.\", \"Please go to slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategy and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system.\", 'We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016 with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.', \"Please go to slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.\", 'North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volume has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets.', \"Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-American – North American business for us; and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipment to be down high-single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low-single digits.\", 'Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full-year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about two percentage points. While these revenue outlets do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates. We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.', \"For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margin. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.\", 'Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note, for 2016 currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full-year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year.', 'Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis.', 'Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32.', 'For the full-year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion.', \"And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence that this won't be crated. (31:39). Our operating system is gaining momentum. And I'm confident in our management team, and we feel good about our forecast for the remainder of the year.\", 'So with that, Sue and I will take your questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Hi, good morning, guys.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Josh.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Morning.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Just on the price-cost equation here, clearly a pretty strong contribution in the first quarter. Can you help us with how that dimensions out, just based on purchasing agreements and hedges you already have in place, over the balance of the year?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Absolutely. So you're right. The 160 basis point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis because last year we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points.\", \"But what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half-second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, though Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where I think you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a big execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment.\", \"But as it comes to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally I think those are going to be pretty stable.\", \"We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment and I think we'll have a great result.\", 'So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year I think 30 basis points to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance. And as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016.', 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', \"Great. That's helpful. And then, Sue, just as a follow-up, I remember last quarter you talked about some of the toggles for the tax rate and specifically mentioned intercompany debt. Could you just maybe update us where we're at on the total tax strategy in light of some of the Treasury rulings?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Right. So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we've looked at all of the proposed Treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016.\", \"As we think about the tax strategy that I talked about, getting us into a low-20s% type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do – trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned, and other tax-efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go.\", \"We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs so that we're all working on taxes, we do our plans, and we do our forward looks. And I think that'll help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed Treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impact that might be out there from the regulations, but no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward.\", 'Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.', 'Perfect. Thanks for the answer.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', \"I guess my first question, maybe starting on Industrial where you did see decelerating trends. I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly there were some cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year. And so I'm just wondering is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial and I guess what's the strategy at this point?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Yeah. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year, and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about a $0.01 for each of the next three quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we look at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring, and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about Industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in.\", 'Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down, so bookings are up, which is good.', \"The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals. But also importantly as we think about ECC and that business is we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined.\", 'So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you see some strengths in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Joe, remember, too, that I think that we've been serial restructurers now for years, and that's both qualified and non-qualified. So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we are seeing in this business, we're getting numbers like seven years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running plants, utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants.\", \"If you couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, that's a 24-month to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any larger restructuring when this thing turns around because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious.\", \"So we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. So we're very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it. And we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'That makes sense, Mike. I guess maybe my follow-on question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say that 2Q North America commercial HVAC bookings were expected to be up about 25%?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yes, that's correct.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'And is that the reason for the organic revenue guidance raise?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"That's more of an impact in 2017 and it's got a little bit of a positive in 2016, a little bit of a positive in 2018. But the bulk of that would be 2017 shipments. So it's really the strength of the business across the board. Unitary continues to be strong. The pipeline looks strong for us. Europe has been a great success story. I think it will continue as well. And of course the residential business continues to put up some very big numbers.\", \"And so all of that combined has got more to do with the guidance increase than the large booking number in quarter two. By the way, quarter three should look pretty good for us as well. Although I don't have a prognostication on the percentage rate, it should be a good quarter for us.\", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.', 'Helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.', 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', \"Hi. Thank you. I just want to say thanks a lot to Janet for all the help, and all the best. In terms of the first question, that would really be back on the Industrial margins. They used to be at sort of 16%, 17% of the odd quarter here and there, and they are down to 9% to 10% right now. And the guidance embeds that by the end of the year I guess they climb back into the sort of low-teens in the next three quarters. So maybe just help clarify what's driving that sort of 400 point-plus margin recovery. Is it just about productivity or is there something going on with the mix as well of Industrial versus compression?\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"So Julian, great question. On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct that in the back half of the year we do have the operating margins for Industrial improving into the low-teens. And as we look at what's going to happen in the back half of the year, it truly is productivity, still lower inflationary type of rates. So you've got productivity offsetting other inflation. You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front.\", \"I don't want anyone to think there is a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this; we have not. But there is by virtue of how the quarters pan out roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and market decline.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"There was also, Julian, the cost control there is exceptional. So even though you were seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring, there's at least that much, maybe more than that which would be non-qualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or fulfilling spending. So there is a cost for that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around head count, some of which is qualified, some of which is non-qualified in terms of how we would actually account for it.\", 'The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through when we would see a 17% margin business.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"All right. That's great. So when I look at it – so the first thing that we did is we went back and said at the time that we gave the original 17% margin guidance for the Industrial business, the revenues in the business were in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory.\", \"So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and I think the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margin. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back.\", \"Right now, we haven't seen the markets actually stop falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return, but again I think the way I'm thinking about it is once the revenues get back up into the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion area where they were when we gave that guidance, that we'll be nearing those 17% type of margins for Industrial.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Remember, when you look at the gross margins of that business and look at the fixed cost of that business say relative to the Climate segment, you can see very easily why that business snaps back very strongly on volume. So when volume returns to that business, we'll get very aggressive incremental margins out of that. In the short term, we're controlling the heck out of costs the best we can. However, we're not going to spite our nose to save our face as it relates to capacity.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Thanks. And then just my follow-up quickly would be, on your overall firm-wide margin bridge, Q1 you had about 10 points or 10 bps from productivity and other inflation. I guess based on what you just said, should we think the number for the year ends up somewhere between that 10 bps and the sort of the 90 bps tailwind that you had last year for the year as a whole?', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"I do think that you will – we do see other inflation to be higher in the first half versus the second half is when our salary increases takes place. That's when a lot of the benefits take place. So when I look at what we plan for the full year, I would say it probably looks more like 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year, Julian.\", 'Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (', 'Perfect. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Nigel.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Good morning.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Hi. I really hope Janet isn't calling a peak here. I don't think she is. But thanks for all the help.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'She is fine.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"So this North American auto expenses is really interesting, Mike, and I'm assuming that's really driven by these large-type projects, finally some big spend (49:04). I'm just wondering what's changed here. I mean is it just a case of old equipment we're seeing here, so the extended replacement cycle can move through? Is it budgetary? I mean any color there would be helpful.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah. Nigel, I think all that's true, but the constant persistent investment we've made over five years, six years, seven years in that business, the constant investment in the channel and the service footprint is really paying off. And I just think the focus we've had on all of that development being around energy efficiency, sustainability, new refrigerant development, all of that is such a powerful story when you look at it.\", 'This is what we were waiting for. This is what we hoped to have seen, which is outsized growth relative to the market and outsized profitability or margin expansion relative to the market. So this is a huge effort by lots of people all the way through to the technicians providing service on the street for us. This is a real accomplishment.', 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', 'Okay. And obviously very early to call 2017 at this point, but if you just look at your North American commercial HVAC operations based on the backlog of pipeline, is it reasonable to assume that perhaps you might see some acceleration next year?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, the thing you have to think about though is what happens to the office and retail business. As an example, our national accounts business has been doing extremely well into retail. Office building is doing really well, as you can see, kind of the high-teens bookings rate again. Unitary, that's been strong again.\", \"Some point you'd think that that would begin to subside and be replaced by stronger applied growth, which I think will happen. So I think what you end up with is maybe a change in the mix between unitary and applied, but I do think continued strong performance through 2017.\", 'Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC', \"Great. Thanks, Mike. That's helpful.\", 'Operator', 'And our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Hey, guys. Good morning.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Steve.', 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', 'Good morning.', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"On the Climate side, I mean just a very big margin number, obviously, and I'm trying to just wrap my head around the seasonality dynamics, 1Q to 2Q. In the last couple years you've had increases, like in 2014 you guys saw a doubling or almost a tripling of the profit number in Climate. Can you just maybe speak to maybe what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is the seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things, or just maybe help us square that, just with the first quarter basis so high that just having trouble kind of getting low enough in Climate.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Yeah, Steve, so I think that looking at something certainly in the 16% margin range for the entire segment is going to make a lot of sense for us. Again, to Sue's point, price I think subsides a little bit, material inflation kind of clips along pretty much at the same rate, bookings look good, pipeline looks fairly strong. We're not seeing – the container business on the transport side being down of course is not all that problematic for us in terms of margins as long as European trailer and North American trailer are doing well. So you put that all together and you're probably dealing with something in the 16% range.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Can you at some point soon kind of get to that 17%? Will you kind of hit that at some point this year?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"I don't know. I mean, really looking at Q3 and Q4 at that level of granularity around guidance, Steve, I don't know. I mean Q2 is seasonally a pretty good quarter for us. Quarter three can be. So we've got an outside shot at something like that.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Okay. And then just on the kind of go-forward leverage, so you had this nice pop off the bottom on margins. Should we continue to expect that if this kind of current mix holds, that if commercial HVAC does really continue to roll on here and we have a bit more of an extended cycle than I think most people were expecting probably three months to four months ago, can you still leverage that business really well, or do you have to add cost or anything like that? I mean I feel like you got to have plenty of capacity here to let it rip a little bit before you start to throw money at the business from a capacity perspective, right?', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Well, the service business and the controls business are growing so well, too, and our margins are obviously much higher. So it's a little bit distorting about how we might think about fixed costs being factory costs. So I do think that there is some capacity we have even in our field service and controls capability that wouldn't require incremental investment. Obviously it's feet on the street, but we stay in front of that, and we typically hire long in the service business. So I don't see why having leverage for the full year – it starts with a 4 – would be a problem in the Climate business.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', \"Okay. And then one last quick one. You guys took up the price cost year-over-year by I think 40 bps you said, but you only took your margins up by 30 bps. Anything – that's just volume and mix at Industrial, is that kind of that moving part?\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Well, inflation kicks in just in terms of wage increases beginning in April for the full year, and we kind of see sort of the cost increase there as well. Puts a little bit of a squeeze...', 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Okay.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"...on margins there. But fundamentally, Steve, there's not anything really changing other than the fact that it's hard to believe that price would stay high as it normally is, and material inflation should stay about where it is, but we're looking at just closing that gap a little bit probably from the price side.\", 'Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC', 'Great.

I saw product launching between August and December, Jeff. It's one of the best stories I've seen, absolutely the fastest cycle time between ideation and product launch. They're hitting it right on the money in terms of what the customers are looking for. It's been a great story for us on the ECC side in Europe.\", \"But I'll also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate in the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting. And the openness around that – and then the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish.\", 'Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC', \"And then could you address what's going on in 14 SEER?

And I think the great news about the 14 SEER is what we saw was the balance of 14 SEER and greater product is still about 80% of the revenues in 2016. So we're seeing price, we're seeing the favorable mix that we expected out of the product. And we're also seeing that the balance between 14 SEER and even the 15 SEER and above has not really changed, which does create a good environment as you alluded to with the price and cost differential.\", 'Jeffrey T.

It was a combination of residential and also Thermo King. On the Thermo King side, and one of the things that we saw was we saw more strength than we expected in truck and trailer both in North America and in Europe. And then the big declines on Thermo King came from the marine container business that I said was down about 60%. So the 40 basis points of mix was primarily from res and from Thermo King.

We're beginning to also see interest in what's referred to as four-pipe chiller. So this is simultaneous heat and cooling around water circulating through buildings versus refrigerant. It's big in Europe, picking up a little bit of interest in the U.S.\", \"The idea here is we're going to have whatever products are demanded in the marketplace, and then we're going to work with our customers to figure out what the best solution is for the building. And that's why our business was up 30% last year. It's why our business is up about the same this year as well.\", 'Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC', 'Okay. Great. Thank you.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'And that concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Miss Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks.', 'Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations', \"Thank you. And thank you, everybody. Joe and I will be available for follow-up calls later today and it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. Have a great day. Thanks.\", 'Operator']","', 'Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ingersoll-Rand First Quarter 2016 Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.', \"I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Janet Pfeffer. Ma'am, you may begin.\", 'Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations', \"Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's first quarter 2016 conference call. We released earnings at 6:30 this morning and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting in addition to this call through our website at ingersollrand.com, and that's also where you'll find the slide presentation that we'll be referring to this morning. The call will be recorded and archived on our website.\", \"If you'd please go to slide two.

Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Thanks, Janet. For those of you who don't know, that's Janet's last time she'll be to read the Safe Harbor statement. She's retiring at the end of this month after a brilliant career at Ingersoll-Rand. We're going to miss Janet greatly. And, Janet, I want to wish you and Ron all the best in your retirement.\", 'Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations', 'Thank you.', 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses.\", \"Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I said before, critical to any sustained cultural transformation, our employees are engaged, their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll-Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.\", \"Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full-year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat. Now this morning I'm going to you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year.\", \"I thought it would be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy, and then I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year.\", \"So over the past 16 weeks I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams.\", \"And as always I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us.\", \"With that, let's go to slide 4. And I'm going to note that all my comments are on an organic basis so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. And I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC recent, put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth. And we believe this should continue through at least 2017.\", 'We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets, within the institutional markets; education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter coupled with high-single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out too that we expect to see a record for quarter two with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter two as a result of some large institutional project awards.', \"We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we've seen growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter one of 2016 with double-digit growth in our controls and service business. With over 4,300 company direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVA service to commercial customers in the world.\", \"Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs. Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.\", \"I'm occasionally asked what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll-Rand, and in reading some of the sell-side reports I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you. According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter over the past six quarters including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter one of 2016, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter one brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high-single-digit range for the year.\", \"The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies, and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential Controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.\", 'Shifting to North America and transport refrigeration markets, as usual the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year.', 'ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, and their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%. We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast to approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance from last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.', 'Our truck refrigeration business was also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to Class 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.', 'As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth.', 'We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high-single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake of the new product introductions. And like North America, the service business also grew at a double-digit rate.', \"I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made in the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With the FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.\", \"Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and it's not that consistent month to month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on in increasing our direct channel market investment to achieve fuller market coverage.\", \"Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter one and up low-teens for Asia Pacific as a whole. Our strategic focus on growing the service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow, and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences. Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia.\", 'So concluding, the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update would take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remain fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we are pleased with our performance in the market. We have expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace.', \"Let's move to slide five. And here we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low-single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focused in growing our service businesses across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy.\", 'In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds at utilization readings above 80%.', \"On one visit I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 gallons to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this PhD physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying it's when the telephone rings, and fortunately he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours in that area.\", \"So whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is to that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016.\", 'To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, when you look at compressors between five horsepower and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between five horsepower and 15 horsepower, is off roughly 10%, while compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first two industry-reported months of the quarter. Smaller compressors quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book and turn with inventory re-stocking occurring in that category.', 'We also believe we are seeing some re-stocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business. Our material handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business we have a management team doing a very good job exhibiting strong cost control, execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines in projected global market growth.', \"In Europe we're seeing increased exports to industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea. And China's power consumption index has also shown growth in the first two months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.\", \"So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.\", 'So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating systems to deliver well above industry average results.', \"Now I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance.\", 'Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President', \"Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let costs get ahead of revenues in the quarter.\", 'Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5% both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter, with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015.', 'Large centrifugal compressors and other Industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth. Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.', 'Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1 our capital deployment actions included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter.', \"Please go to slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments, and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance.\", 'Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.', 'Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range (18:44).', 'Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and will spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.', 'Please go to slide right. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.', 'We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Regionally for commercial HVAC, we saw high-single-digit booking increases with a high-single-digit increase in North America and Europe, up low-teens in Asia, and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America.', 'Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low-single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low-single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car.', 'Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors while freeing (20:23) in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.', \"Please go to slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.\", 'Our Industrial segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe while Asia was flat and North America was down high-single digits.', \"Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control.\", 'Please go to slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.', 'Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.', 'Please go to slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 basis points and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4% respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending. The leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America.', 'Europe had low-single digit equipment growth and high-single digits in services and trucking and (24:00) parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales. Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement.', 'First quarter organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.', 'Please go to slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low-single digits and were flat in Asia.', \"Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.6% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive, productivity offset other inflation, and volume and mix were unfavorable.\", 'Please go to slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability.', \"For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we're well-positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier-volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.\", \"Please go to slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategy and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system.\", 'We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016 with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.', \"Please go to slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.\", 'North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volume has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets.', \"Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-American – North American business for us; and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipment to be down high-single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low-single digits.\", 'Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full-year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about two percentage points. While these revenue outlets do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates. We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.', \"For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margin. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.\", 'Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note, for 2016 currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full-year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year.', 'Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis.', 'Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32.', 'For the full-year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion.', \"And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.\", 'Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer', \"Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence that this won't be crated. (31:39). Our operating system is gaining momentum.
